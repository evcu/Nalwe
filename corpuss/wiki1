 anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self governed societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non hierarchical free associations anarchism considers the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful the following sources cite anarchism as a political philosophy because anarchists generally believe that human beings are capable of managing their own affairs on the basis of creativity cooperation and mutual respect and when making individual decisions they are taking into the account others while anti statism is central anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations including but not limited to the state system anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications anarchism is usually considered a radical left wing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics etymology and terminology the term is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the greek i e anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix an i e without and archos i e leader ruler cf archon or arkh i e authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix izein the first known use of this word was in one five three nine various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as robespierre did the h bertists although few shared many views of later anarchists there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century since the one eight nine zero s and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the one nine five zero s in the united states its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism history origins woodcut from a diggers document by william everard the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the six th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist zhuangzi wrote a petty thief is put in jail a great becomes a ruler of a nation diogenes of sinope and the cynics their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition georges lechartier wrote that the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society later some muslim scholars such as amer al basri and abu hanifa led movements of boycotting the rulers paving the way to the waqf endowments tradition which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs but such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic taoist teachings and that of other anti authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible this is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry the french renaissance political philosopher tienne de la bo tie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the one seven th century in england the term anarchist first entered the english language in one six four two during the english civil war as a term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents by the time of the french revolution some such as the enrag s began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic by the turn of the one nine th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jean jacques rousseau s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom as part of the political turmoil of the one seven nine zero s in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought godwin was according to peter kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke upright william godwin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice one seven nine three that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution his aversion to the imposition of a rules based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people s mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment the french pierre joseph proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in one eight four zero it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propri t where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use later however proudhon added that property is liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time the anarcho communist joseph d jacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike pierre joseph proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature in one eight four four in germany the post hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book the ego and its own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism french anarchists active in the one eight four eight revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph d jacque and pierre joseph proudhon first international and the paris commune upright collectivist anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of one eight four eight during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt in spain ram n de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coru a in one eight four five which was inspired by proudhon s ideas the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhon s works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in one eight seven three while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party according to george woodcock these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after one eight seven zero but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early one eight six zero s according to the encyclopedia britannica during the spanish revolution of one eight seven three pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralized or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines in one eight six four the international workingmen s association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats due to its links to active workers movements the international became a significant organisation karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william b greene had been members of the first international in one eight six eight following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads bakunin characterised marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against anarchist historian george woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in one eight seven zero owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in one eight seven one the general council called only a special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the f d ration romande was used to avoid inviting bakunin s swiss supporters thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council s resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers in one eight seven two the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist program the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from one eight march more formally from two eight march to two eight may one eight seven one the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco prussian war anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune they included louise michel the reclus brothers and eugene varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the re opening of workplaces as co operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised moreover the commune s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas indeed the commune s vision of a communal france based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin s and proudhon s ideas proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in one eight four eight and for federation of communes thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas george woodcock states organised labour the anti authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organisation of labour in one eight eight six the federation of organized trades and labor unions fotlu of the united states and canada unanimously set one may one eight eight six as the date by which the eight hour work day would become standard upright a sympathetic engraving by walter crane of the executed anarchists of chicago after the haymarket affair the haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances in response unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event on three may in chicago a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd the next day four may anarchists staged a rally at chicago s haymarket square a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other seven police officers and at least four workers were killed eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day in one eight nine zero a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as a once off event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday in one nine zero seven the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from one four different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri beno t broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it the spanish workers federation in one eight eight one was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the confederaci n nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in one nine one zero before the one nine four zero s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting one five eight million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association a federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in one nine two two with delegates representing two million workers from one five countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early one nine two zero s most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish c n t as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organizations was the federaci n obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions propaganda of the deed and illegalism upright italian american anarchist luigi galleani his followers known as galleanists carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from one nine one four to one nine three two in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda by the one eight eight zero s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides from one nine zero five onwards the russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations illegalism as a practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt france s bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism however as soon as one eight eight seven important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le r volt that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement the anarcho syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in one eight nine five for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter state repression including the infamous one eight nine four french lois sc l rates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the one eight seven one paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts historian benedict anderson thus writes in march one eight seven one the commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months then versailles seized the moment to attack and in one horrifying week executed roughly two zero zero zero zero communards or suspected sympathizers a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during robespierre s terror of one seven nine three one seven nine four more than seven five zero zero were jailed or deported to places like new caledonia thousands of others fled to belgium england italy spain and the united states in one eight seven two stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left not till one eight eight zero was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned communards meanwhile the third republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce louis napoleon s imperialist expansion in indochina africa and oceania many of france s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the commune courbet was its quasi minister of culture rimbaud and pissarro were active propagandists or were sympathetic to it the ferocious repression of one eight seven one and thereafter was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the third republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad according to some analysts in post war germany the prohibition of the communist party kdp and thus of institutional far left political organisation may also in the same manner have played a role in the creation of the red army faction numerous heads of state were assassinated between one eight eight one and one nine one four by members of the anarchist movement including tsar alexander ii of russia president sadi carnot of france empress elisabeth of austria king umberto i of italy president william mckinley of the united states king carlos i of portugal and king george i of greece mckinley s assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after world war i one nine one four one nine one eight and the one nine one seven october revolution russian revolution and other uprisings of the one nine one zero s nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution however following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left wing opposition the conflict culminated in the one nine two one kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine there in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were amongst those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised for them bakunin s predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international the revolutionary wave of one nine one seven two three saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism in the german uprising known as the german revolution of one nine one eight one nine one nine which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich m hsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures in the italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarcho syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to eight zero zero zero zero zero members and the influence of the italian anarchist union two zero zero zero zero members plus umanita nova its daily paper grew accordingly anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early one nine one zero s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho communist ricardo flores mag n in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their one nine two six manifesto called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the one nine two zero s this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations conflicts with european fascist regimes in the one nine two zero s and one nine three zero s the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism s conflict with the state italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists italian anarchists played a key role in the anti fascist organisation arditi del popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august one nine two two the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counter revolution in france where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february one nine three four riots anarchists divided over a united front policy anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii in germany the anarchist erich m hsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of two eight february one nine three three within a few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin joseph goebbels the nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those jewish subversives over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg brandenburg and finally oranienburg on two february one nine three four m hsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of nine july one nine three four m hsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning spanish revolution in spain the national anarcho syndicalist trade union confederaci n nacional del trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory but in one nine three six the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war one nine three six one nine three nine in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land but even before the fascist victory in one nine three nine the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in one nine three six and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante much of spain s economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as seven five but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history spanish communist party led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri who volunteered to fight against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non francoist mayor of the city the anarchist melchor rodr guez garc a post war years anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france the mexican anarchist federation was established in one nine four five after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district in the early one nine four zero s the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociaci n libertaria de cuba cuban libertarian association from one nine four four to one nine four seven the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new communist regime in one nine four five in france the f d ration anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union conf d ration nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september one nine four five and in one nine four six the japanese anarchist federation was founded an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may one nine four eight after world war ii an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them by february one nine four six the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was a large scale operation the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in one nine four seven and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ die freie gesellschaft which survived until one nine five three in one nine five six the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded in one nine five five the anarcho communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation the syndicalist workers federation was a syndicalist group in active in post war britain and one of solidarity federation s earliest predecessors it was formed in one nine five zero by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain unlike the afb which was influenced by anarcho syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the swf decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist worker centred strategy from the outset anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as albert camus herbert read paul goodman dwight macdonald allen ginsberg george woodcock leopold kohr julian beck john cage and the french surrealist group led by andr breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the f d ration anarchiste anarcho pacifism became influential in the anti nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day anarcho pacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham s anarchism a documentary history of libertarian ideas volume two the emergence of the new anarchism one nine three nine one nine seven seven contemporary anarchism the famous okupas squat near parc g ell overlooking barcelona squatting was a prominent part of the emergence of renewed anarchist movement from the counterculture of the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s on the roof occupy and resist a surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the one nine six zero s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts in one nine six eight in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in one nine six eight by the three existing european federations of france the f d ration anarchiste the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile in the united kingdom in the one nine seven zero s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain in denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen since the revival of anarchism in the mid two zero th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha feminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the one nine six zero s anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the one nine th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and cultural critical ideas and who by the turn of the two one st century formed by far the majority of anarchists around the turn of the two one st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti war anti capitalist and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight and the world economic forum some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet a significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in one nine nine nine according to anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo libertarianism of contemporary neo liberalism one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socio economic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations the international workers association and international libertarian solidarity the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederaci n general del trabajo cgt and the cnt cgt membership was estimated at around one zero zero zero zero zero for two zero zero three other active syndicalist movements include in sweden the central organisation of the workers of sweden and the swedish anarcho syndicalist youth federation the cnt ait in france the unione sindicale italiana in italy in the us workers solidarity alliance and the uk solidarity federation and anarchist federation the revolutionary industrial unionist industrial workers of the world claiming three zero zero zero paying members and the international workers association an anarcho syndicalist successor to the first international also remain active anarchist schools of thought upright portrait of philosopher pierre joseph proudhon one eight zero nine one eight six five by gustave courbet proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many later individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i e opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill recognizing equality of entitlement in a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the one nine th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid two zero th century and after beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del m rmol in one eight eight nine in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i e collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought classical anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in one eight th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order it is important to recognize that proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated

philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict in one seven nine three william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good one nine th century philosopher max stirner usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist sketch by friedrich engels an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and best known proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner stirner s the ego and its own published in one eight four four is a founding text of the philosophy according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality stirner advocated self assertion and foresaw unions of egoists non systematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirner s philosophy it was re discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and lgbt activist john henry mackay josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the four page weekly paper he edited during one eight three three the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as one eight four eight and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william b greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form henry david thoreau one eight one seven one eight six two was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist he is best known for his books walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state later benjamin tucker fused stirner s egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarcho naturism freethought and anti clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others social anarchism social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion it is the largest school of thought in anarchism social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production however collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a post revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need anarcho communism anarchist communism also known as anarcho communism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need upright russian theorist peter kropotkin one eight four two one nine two one who was influential in the development of anarchist communism some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarcho communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom most anarcho communists view anarcho communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society anarcho communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro organisationalist and insurrectionary anti organisationalist sections to date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society i e established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in one nine three six anarchist communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war hitler mussolini spanish communist party repression backed by the ussr as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself during the russian revolution anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend through the revolutionary insurrectionary army

spanish anarcho syndicalist trade union cnt in bilbao basque country in two zero one zero anarcho syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement anarcho syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are workers direct action and workers self management anarcho syndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position will allow workers to liberate themselves moreover anarcho syndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarcho syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be self managing they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho syndicalist movement he outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his one nine three eight pamphlet anarcho syndicalism the international workers association is an international anarcho syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries the spanish confederaci n nacional del trabajo played and still plays a major role in the spanish labour movement it was also an important force in the spanish civil war post classical schools of thought lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarcho primitivism while jarach is a noted advocate of post left anarchy anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches green anarchism or eco anarchism is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues with an important precedent in anarcho naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho primitivism and social ecology anarcha feminism also called anarchist feminism and anarcho feminism combines anarchism with feminism it generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association anarcha feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state in essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa l susan brown claims that as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist anarcha feminism began with the late one nine th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre anarcho pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see non violence it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda s organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the one nine one seven october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement s failures during the russian revolution synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the one nine two zero s this form found as its main proponents the anarcho communists voline and s bastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations post left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism s relationship to traditional left wing politics some post leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international post left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies post anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought drawing from diverse ideas including post modernism autonomist marxism post left anarchy situationist international and postcolonialism left wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anti corporatist anti hierarchical pro labor positions and anti capitalism in economics and anti imperialism in foreign policy anarcho capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market anarcho capitalism developed from radical anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory there is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms internal issues and debates which forms of violence if any are consistent with anarchist values is a controversial subject among anarchists anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism and capitalism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilization technology e g within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others on a tactical level while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the one nine th century e g the nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence counter economics and anti state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory topics of interest intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory free love upright french individualist anarchist emile armand one eight seven two one nine six two who propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early two zero th century an important current within anarchism is free love free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of an individual s sovereignty free love particularly stressed women s rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and anti birth control measures the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer one eight eight three one nine zero

american individualist anarchist who promoted free love in new york city s greenwich village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self realisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman among others magnus hirschfeld noted in one nine two three that goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public in fact before goldman heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel one eight four nine one eight nine eight spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the one

voice which was published nine times in rosario between eight january one eight nine six and one january one eight nine seven and was revived briefly in one nine zero one in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults he was also a consistent proponent of polyamory in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality mujeres libres was an anarchist women s organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women it was founded in one nine three six by luc a s nchez saornil mercedes comaposada and amparo poch y gasc n and had approximately three zero zero zero zero members the organisation was based on the idea of a double struggle for women s liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists luc a s nchez saornil was a main founder of the spanish anarcha feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism she was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to censorship and punishment more recently the british anarcho pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex the issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho hedonist philosopher michel onfray in

josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established max stirner wrote in one eight four two a long essay on education called the false principle of our education in it stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that self understanding consists in hourly self creation education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment in the united states freethought was a basically anti christian anti clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters a number of contributors to liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism the individualist anarchist george macdonald was a co editor of freethought and for a time the truth seeker e c walker was co editor of the excellent free thought free love journal lucifer the light bearer many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as lucifer the light bearer freethought and the truth seeker appeared in liberty the church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself in one nine zero one catalan anarchist and free thinker francesc ferrer i gu rdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church the schools stated goal was to educate the working class in a rational secular and non coercive setting fiercely anti clerical ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state murray bookchin wrote this period one eight nine zero s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence perhaps the best known effort in this field was francisco ferrer s modern school escuela moderna a project which exercised a considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally la escuela moderna and ferrer s ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools in the united states cuba south america and london the first of these was started in new york city in one nine one one it also inspired the italian newspaper universit popolare founded in one nine zero one russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate tolstoy s educational experiments were short lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture he thought that education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself education is culture under restraint culture is free education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture a more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child led activity replaces pedagogic approaches experiments in germany led to a s neill founding what became summerhill school in one nine two one summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle approach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead criticisms criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics european history professor carl landauer in his book european socialism argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a lesser evil than a society without repressive force he also argued that ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears is

genereviewsnbk nbk one four four two genereviewsname autism overview autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction verbal and non verbal communication and restricted and repetitive behavior parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress the diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood typically before age three while autism is highly heritable researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes in rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypotheses have been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood in the dsm v it is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum asds the other two being asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as pdd nos which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or asperger syndrome are not met early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder globally autism is estimated to affect two one seven million people as of two zero one three as of two zero one zero the number of people affected is estimated at about one two per one zero zero zero worldwide it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls about one five of children in the united states one in six eight are diagnosed with asd a three zero increase from one in eight eight in two zero one two the rate of autism among adults aged one eight years and over in the united kingdom is one one the number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the one nine eight zero s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved characteristics autism spectrum disorder video autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person s own emotions children with high functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums communication about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in a pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged eight one five performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends repetitive behavior autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs r categorizes as follows alt sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line a young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row stereotypy is repetitive movement such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules such as arranging objects in stacks or lines sameness is resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors restricted behavior is limited in focus interest or activity such as preoccupation with a single television program toy or game self injury includes movements that injure or can injure the person such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated zero five to one zero of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over nine zero of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated six zero eight zero of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and asd is unclear parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults causes it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur alt three diagrams of chromosome pairs a b that are nearly identical one b is missing a segment of a two b has two adjacent copies of a segment of a three b s copy of a s segment is in reverse order deletion one duplication two and inversion three are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is zero seven for autism and as high as zero nine for asd and siblings of those with autism are about two five times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than one of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents diesel exhaust pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress but no evidence has been found for these claims and some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism the latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children mechanism autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies pathophysiology alt two diagrams of major brain structures implicated in autism the upper diagram shows the cerebral cortex near the top and the basal ganglia in the center just above the amygdala and hippocampus the lower diagram shows the corpus callosum near the center the cerebellum in the lower rear and the brain stem in the lower center autism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors just after birth the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following an excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation unbalanced excitatory inhibitory networks abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines for example by modulation of the neurexin neuroligin cell adhesion system or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated the immune system is thought to play an important role in autism children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response it is thought that activation of a pregnant mother s immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development this is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism the relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport the role of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors mglur in the pathogenesis of fragile x syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than five of cases the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd however individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object upright alt a human brain viewed from above about one zero is highlighted in yellow and one zero in blue there is only a tiny perhaps zero five green region where they overlap autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for a movement task compared to a control group blue asd related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the task positive network used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex from studies based on event related potentials transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli for example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals in the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with one q two one one deletion syndrome research on autism schizophrenia relations for chromosome one five one five q one three three chromosome one six one six p one three one and chromosome one seven one seven p one two are inconclusive functional connectivity studies have found both hypo and hyper connectivity in brains of people with autism hypo connectivity seems to dominate especially for interhemispheric and cortico cortical functional connectivity neuropsychology two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition simon baron cohen s empathizing systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing these theories are somewhat related to baron cohen s earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the sally anne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis however most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition in his review kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people a related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the dsm five autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay icd one zero uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi r is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as landau kleffner syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated four zero of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile x testing a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age one four months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most three zero weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from one five to three zero months of age the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age one eight months and about four fifths notice by age two four months according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome no babbling by one two months no gesturing pointing waving etc by one two months no single words by one six months no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by two four months any loss of any language or social skills at any age the united states preventative services task force in two zero one six found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at one eight and two four months using autism specific formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers m chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on m chat and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged one eight three zero months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features prevention infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than one of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases management alt a young child points in front of a woman who smiles and points in the same direction a three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit there is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention eibi an early intervention model based on aba for two zero to four zero hours a week for multiple years is an effective treatment for some children with asd two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis aba and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment education educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children similarly teacher implemented intervention that utilizes an aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well established treatment in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers medication many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole have been found to be useful for treating irritability repetitive behavior and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests some alternative treatments may place the child at risk a two zero zero eight study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diets in two zero zero five botched chelation therapy killed a five year old child with autism there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism there is no good evidence that a gluten free diet is of benefit in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviours cost treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so for someone born in two zero

are associated with likelihood of family financial problems one two zero zero eight us study found a one four average loss of annual income in families of children with asd and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance after childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning society and culture the rainbow colored infinity is often used as a symbol for the diversity of the autism spectrum as well as neurodiversity in general the emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism through this movement people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease proponents of this movement wish to seek acceptance not cures there have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as world autism awareness day light it up blue autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others there have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone s life these organizations include autism speaks autism national committee autism society of america and many others social science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism rain man a film that won four oscars including best picture depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities while many autistics don t have these special abilities there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields prognosis there is no known cure children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from three to two five most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age few high quality studies address long term prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above five zero and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood epidemiology alt bar chart versus time the graph rises steadily from one nine nine six to two zero zero seven from about zero seven to about five three the trend curves slightly upward reports of autism cases per one zero zero zero children grew dramatically in the us from one nine nine six to two zero zero seven it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in rates of autism most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of one two per one zero zero zero for autism and close to six per one zero zero zero for asd and one one per one zero zero zero children in the united states for asd as of two zero zero eight because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate asd s true rate globally autism affects an estimated two one seven million people as of two zero one three while asperger syndrome affects a further

cases of autism increased dramatically in the one nine nine zero s and early two zero zero zero s this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics boys are at higher risk for asd than girls the sex ratio averages four three one and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to two one with intellectual disability and more than five five one without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism they include genetic disorders about one zero one five of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders intellectual disability the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from two five to seven zero a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence in comparison for pdd nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of asperger s excludes intellectual disability anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from one one to eight four many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd s symptoms epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population preempted diagnoses although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis history upright alt balding man in his early six zero s in coat and tie with a serious but slightly smiling expression leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of a one two year old boy who may have been severely autistic luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in a one seven four seven court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair s marriage to gain blair s inheritance the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in one seven nine eight showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in one nine one zero as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word aut s meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance the word autism first took its modern sense in one nine three eight when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until one nine eight one leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a one nine four three report of one one children with striking behavioral similarities almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late one nine six zero s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy as late as the mid one nine seven zero s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child s autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being references further reading external links autism communication disorders mental and behavioural disorders neurological disorders neurological disorders in children pervasive developmental disorders psychiatric diagnosis percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions albedo or reflection coefficient derived from latin albedo whiteness or reflected sunlight in turn from albus white is the diffuse reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface it is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it its dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to one for perfect reflection of a white surface because albedo is the ratio of all reflected radiation to incident radiation it will include both the diffuse and specular radiation reflected from an object it is however common to assume a surface reflects in either a totally specular manner or a totally diffuse manner as this can simplify calculations albedo depends on the frequency of the radiation when quoted unqualified it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of visible light in general the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation except for lambertian surfaces which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution in practice a bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface but albedo is very useful as a first approximation the albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and calculating reflectivity of surfaces in leed sustainable rating systems for buildings the average overall albedo of earth its planetary albedo is three zero to three five because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his one seven six zero work photometria terrestrial albedo albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to zero nine for fresh snow to about zero zero four for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of zero one to zero four the average albedo of earth is about zero three this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds two zero zero three two zero zero four mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites as the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite a mathematical model of the brdf is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about one five c if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below four zero c if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about zero c in contrast if the entire earth is covered by water a so called aquaplanet the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under two seven c white sky and black sky albedo it has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle i can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle and the bi hemispherical reflectance bar the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination albedo can then be given as one d bar alpha theta i d bar directional hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and bi hemispherical reflectance as white sky albedo these terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface astronomical albedo the albedos of planets satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with nine nine of em radiation reflected another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of zero nine six many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about zero zero five a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of zero zero four such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around zero one three six but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the v band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is a left frac right two where a is the astronomical albedo d is the diameter in kilometers and h is the absolute magnitude examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination although the albedo temperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year round illumination is greater the maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between three and twelve degrees north the minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and sub tropical rain forest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes climate and weather albedo affects climate and drives weather all weather is a result of the uneven heating of earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos essentially for the driving of weather there are two types of albedo regions on earth land and ocean land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of air masses depending on latitude and therefore insolation warm and dry which form over tropical and sub tropical land masses warm and wet which form over tropical and sub tropical oceans cold and dry which form over temperate polar and sub polar land masses and cold and wet which form over temperate polar and sub polar oceans different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures and the masses develop into pressure systems high pressure systems flow toward lower pressure driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere and south to north in the southern however due to earth s rotation the coriolis effect further complicates flow and creates several weather climate bands and the jet streams albedo temperature feedback when an area s albedo changes due to snowfall a snow temperature feedback results a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area e g a warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as zero nine for freshly fallen snow to about zero four for melting snow and as low as zero two for dirty snow over antarctica they average a little more than zero eight if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets hence small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon a si h and crystalline silicon c si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions research showed impacts of over one zero more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of two two commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications trees because forests generally have a low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are one zero to five zero higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about zero one five to zero one eight whereas coniferous trees have a value of about zero zero nine to zero one five studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph reflectivity of smooth water at two zero c refractive index one three three three at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near zero to a maximum approaching zero eight on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as one zero c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth s radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is zero two w m two with a range zero one to zero four w m two black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo james hansen the efficacy of this forcing is two i e for a given forcing it is twice as effective as co two in altering global surface air temperature compare zender testimony supra note seven at four figure three see j hansen the efficacy for changes of arctic sea ice albedo is three in additional runs not shown here we found that the efficacy of albedo

forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by co two human activities human activities e g deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult other types of albedo single scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on

the iso basic latin alphabet it is similar to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives the upper case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar the lower case version can be written in two forms the double storey a and single storey the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type history the earliest certain ancestor of a is aleph also written aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended in one six zero zero b c e the phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the eight th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter a during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter a first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent mediums there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there as not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include a double storey a and single storey at the end of the roman empire five th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the nine th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through a combining of prior forms one five th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script a is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of a small loop with an arc over it a both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin a such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems english in modern english orthography the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father which is closer to its original latin and greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is followed by one or occasionally two consonants and then another vowel letter this results from middle english lengthening followed by the great vowel shift the modified form of the above sound that occurs before as in square and mary the rounded vowel of water the shorter rounded vowel not present in general american in was and what a schwa in many unstressed syllables as in about comma solar the double sequence does not occur in native english words but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as aaron and aardvark however occurs in many common digraphs all with their own sound or sounds particularly and is the third most commonly used letter in english after and and the second most common in spanish and french in one study on average about three six eight of letters used in english texts tend to be while the number is six two two in spanish and three nine five in french other languages in most languages that use the latin alphabet denotes an open unrounded vowel such as or an exception is saanich in which and the glyph stands for a close mid front unrounded vowel other systems in phonetic and phonemic notation in the international phonetic alphabet is used for the open front unrounded vowel is used for the open central unrounded vowel and is used for the open back unrounded vowel in x sampa is used for the open front unrounded vowel and is used for the open back unrounded vowel other uses in algebra the letter a along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet x y z are used to denote unknown quantities in geometry capital a b c etc are used to denote segments lines rays etc a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a a is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status a a or a the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork a grade for clean restaurants a list celebrities etc such associations can have a motivating effect as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance when compared with other letters finally the letter a is used to denote size as in a narrow size shoe or a small cup size in a brassiere related characters descendants and related characters in the latin alphabet latin ae ligature a with diacritics phonetic alphabet

united states at alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation from the american civil war until world war ii alabama like many states in the south suffered economic hardship in part because of continued dependence on agriculture despite the growth of major industries and urban centers white rural interests dominated the state legislature from one nine zero one to the one nine six zero s as it did not regularly reapportion the legislature from one nine zero one to one nine six one urban interests and african americans were markedly under represented african americans and poor whites were essentially disenfranchised altogether by the state constitution of one nine zero one a status that continued into the mid one nine six zero s before being alleviated by federal legislation exclusion of minorities continued under at large voting systems in most counties some changes were made through a series of omnibus court cases in the late one nine eight zero s to establish different electoral systems following world war ii alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests

charcoal from indigenous camp fires in the cave has been dated as early as six five five zero to six one four five bc the european american naming of the alabama river and state originates from the alabama people a muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for an alabama person is albaamo or variously albaama or alb amo in different dialects the plural form is albaamaha the word alabama is believed to have come from the alabama language and a suggestion that the name was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely the spelling of the word varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of one five four zero with garcilaso de la vega using alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in efforts to transliterate the term as early as one seven zero two the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as rivi re des alibamons other spellings of the appellation have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou and possibly alabahmu the use of state names derived from native american languages is common an estimated two seven states have names of native american origin sources disagree on the meaning of the word some scholars suggested the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an one eight four two article in the jacksonville republican proposed that it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the one eight five zero s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek experts in the muskogean languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation and thus this is probably erroneous history pre european settlement indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before european colonization trade with the northeastern tribes via the ohio

misappropriation organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in one eight seven four when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor s office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in one eight seven five and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in one eight nine one after disfranchising most african

more than one eight one zero zero zero african americans eligible to vote in one nine zero zero the numbers dropped even more in later decades while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote

constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws six zero zero zero zero zero whites vs five two zero zero zero zero african americans nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the one nine six five to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the one nine zero one constitution required racial segregation of public schools it also restated that interracial marriage was illegal as it had been prohibited in one eight six seven into the one nine five zero s the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities jails were segregated in one nine one one hospitals in one nine one five toilets hotels and restaurants in one nine two eight and bus stop waiting rooms in one nine four five the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in one nine one nine it was one of the three eight seven rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in one nine one three the first eight zero rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children a total of three eight seven schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by one nine three seven in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the two zero th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from one nine one zero to one nine two zero at the same time many rural people both white and african american migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city by the one nine two zero s birmingham was the one nine th largest city in the united states and had more than three zero of the state s population heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late one nine six zero s following a lawsuit and court order beginning in the one nine four zero s when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters the legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the fifteenth amendment the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to a two eight sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits the supreme court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the constitution in one nine six one the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between one nine four zero and one nine four three more than eight nine zero zero zero people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from one nine zero one to one nine six one the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas in addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature a one nine six zero study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about two five per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature a class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in lowndes county alabama challenged the state legislature s lack of redistricting for congressional seats in one nine six two white v crook judge frank m johnson ordered the state to redistrict united states supreme court cases of baker v carr one nine six two and reynolds v sims one nine six four ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as alabama had used for its senate in one nine seven two for the first time since one nine zero one the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than six zero years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in

supreme court ruled in brown v board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the one nine six zero s under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott one nine five five five six freedom rides in one

nine seven three alabama constitutional commission the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties there is very limited home rule but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county level functions and policies this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues alabama has made some changes since the late two zero th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the one nine eight zero s an omnibus redistricting case dillard v crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of one eight zero alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cites and counties including chilton county adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation two three jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in one nine eight two limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in

management corporation electronics telecommunications provider at as a result urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds v sims one nine six four the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already had in its constitution but had not implemented further it ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only one six seven th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of executive branch include the cabinet the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor of the state is republican robert bentley the lieutenant governor is republican kay ivey the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the state s highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to choose judges and since the one nine eight zero s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican roy moore all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january taxes alabama levies a two four or five percent personal income tax depending upon the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax and can do so even if taking the standard deduction taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the federal insurance contributions act tax social security and medicare tax the state s general sales tax rate is four sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile is one zero and there is an additional restaurant tax of one which means that a diner in mobile would pay an one one tax on a meal sales and excise taxes in alabama account for five one of all state and local revenue compared with an average of about three six nationwide alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low income families most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate alabama s income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the united states alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as four six zero zero which is barely one quarter of the federal poverty line alabama s threshold is the lowest among the four one states and the district of columbia with income taxes the corporate income tax rate is currently six five the overall federal state and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax burdened state in the country property taxes are the lowest in the u s the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes since alabama s tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure for example in two zero zero three alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as six seven zero million county and local governments alabama has six seven counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems and the state legislators are buried in local county issues the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the one nine seven three alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker v carr one nine six four required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabama s constitution has been amended more than seven zero zero times and almost one third of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance on november nine two zero one one jefferson county which was four billion in debt at the time declared bankruptcy this is the second

eight seven four the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the african american vote through violence fraud and intimidation after one eight nine zero a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents a process completed in provisions of the one nine zero one constitution provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites by one nine four one more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised six zero zero zero zero zero to five two zero zero zero zero the total effects were greater on the african american community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from one nine zero one through the one nine six zero s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in one nine seven two to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s during the american civil rights movement when whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform democrat george wallace the state s only four term governor was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of one nine six four and voting rights act of one nine six five did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by at large electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards in two zero zero seven the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact in a symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america in

visions in the two one st century elections state elections with the disfranchisement of african americans in one nine zero one the state became part of the solid south a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state for nearly one zero zero years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late two zero th century however there has been a realignment among the two major political parties and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majority white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the alabama supreme court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until one nine nine four no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the then incumbent chief justice of alabama ernest c hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately three zero zero zero votes to republican perry o hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august two zero one one with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early two one st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of

achilles and the nereid cymothoe attic red figure kantharos from volci cabinet des m dailles biblioth que nationale paris head of achilles depicted on a four th century bc coin from kremaste phthia reverse thetis wearing chiton and holding shield of achilles with his ax monogram in greek mythology achilles akhilleus was a greek hero of the trojan war and the central character and greatest warrior of homer s iliad his mother was the nymph thetis and his father peleus was the king of the myrmidons achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan hero hector outside the gates of troy although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him in the heel with an arrow later legends beginning with a poem by statius in the one st century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because of his death from a small wound in the heel the term achilles heel has come to mean a person s point of weakness etymology achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of grief and a people tribe nation in other words achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people grief being a theme raised numerous times in the iliad frequently by achilles achilles role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of achilles as the hero of glory usually glory in war laos has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster with this derivation the name would have a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring grief to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership r s p beekes has suggested a pre greek origin of the name the name achilleus was a common and attested name among the greeks soon after the seven th century bc it was also turned into the female form achille a attested in attica in the four th century bc ig ii one six one seven and in the form achillia on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon birth thetis dipping the infant achilles into the river styx ca one six two five peter paul rubens achilles was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus the king of the myrmidons zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of a prophecy that thetis would bear a son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in argonautica iv seven six zero zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus that thetis was so loyal to hera s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him thetis although a daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus the education of achilles ca one seven seven two by james barry according to the achilleid written by statius in the one st century ad and to no surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his heel see achilles heel achilles tendon it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage however none of the sources before statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book two one the paeonian hero asteropaeus son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander he cast two spears at once one grazed achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood also in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which we can find description of the hero s death cypria unknown author aithiopis by arctinus of miletus little iliad by lesche of mytilene iliou persis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness heel in the later vase paintings presenting achilles death the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his body peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur on mt pelion to be reared achilles in the trojan war the rage of achilles by giovanni battista tiepolo the first two lines of the iliad read sing goddess of the rage of peleus son achilles the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the achaeans achilles consuming rage is at times wavering but at other times he cannot be cooled thetis foretold that her son s fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan war according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with five zero ships each carrying five zero myrmidons book two he appointed five leaders each leader commanding five zero zero myrmidons menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon book one six telephus when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed troilus according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighboring cities and killed troilus in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe troilus was a young trojan prince the youngest of king priam s or sometimes apollo and hecuba s five legitimate sons despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible achilles in the iliad achilles sacrificing to zeus from the ambrosian iliad a five th century illuminated manuscript homer s iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war achilles wrath is the central theme of the poem the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war and does not narrate achilles death it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces agamemnon had taken a woman named chryseis as his slave her father chryses a priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him agamemnon refuses and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him achilles does so and calchas declares chryseis must be returned to her father agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis be brought to him to replace chryseis angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loved briseis with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces at this same time burning with rage over agamemnon s theft achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honor as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do the trojans led by hector subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armor though achilles remains at his camp patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy triumphant achilles dragging hector s lifeless body in front of the gates of troy from a panoramic fresco on the upper level of the main hall of the achilleion after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companion s death his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles she persuades hephaestus to make new armor for him in place of the armor that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector the new armor includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who becomes angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself finally achilles finds his prey achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hector s favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles hold his funeral achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honor with the assistance of the god hermes hector s father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hector s body so that he can be buried achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral the poem ends with a description of hector s funeral with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come penthesilea achilles after his temporary truce with priam fought and killed the amazonian warrior queen penthesilea but later grieved over her death at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her memnon and the fall of achilles achilles dying in the gardens of the achilleion in corfu following the death of patroclus achilles closest companion was nestor s son antilochus when memnon king of ethiopia slew antilochus achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield killing memnon the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of a goddess many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliad s description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the seven th century b c the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors the death of achilles as predicted by hector with his dying breath was brought about by paris with an arrow to the heel according to statius in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow ajax carries off the body of achilles attic black figure lekythos ca five one zero bc from sicily staatliche antikensammlungen munich all of these versions deny paris any sort of valor owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield his bones were mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games were held he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena achilles asks priam for polyxena s hand in marriage priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world s greatest warrior but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him in the odyssey agamemnon informs achilles of his burial mound while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles fate of achilles armor achilles armor was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of odysseus furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned the ire of athena athena temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades after a while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide odysseus eventually gave the armor to neoptolemus the son of achilles a relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia a port on the pamphylian gulf the city was visited in three three three bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of pausanias in the two nd century ad upright seven five achilles and ajax playing the board game petteia black figure attic lekythos ca five zero zero bc achilles ajax and a game of petteia numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing a board game petteia they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena achilles and patroclus the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times in the iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures in five th century bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia in plato s symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover but ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women worship of achilles in antiquity achilles and briseis penthesilea brought her amazon warriors to help the trojans defend their city but was killed in combat by achilles here achilles looms above her as she sinks to the ground there was an archaic heroic cult of achilles on the white island leuce in the black sea off the modern coasts of romania and ukraine with a temple and an oracle which survived into the roman period in the lost epic aithiopis a continuation of the iliad attributed to arktinus of miletos achilles mother thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to leuce at the mouths of the danube there the achaeans raised a tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games pliny s natural history mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident insula akchillis tumulo eius viri clara on the island consecrated to him located at a distance of fifty roman miles from peuce by the danube delta and the temple there pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue ruins of a square temple three zero meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in one eight two three but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island pomponius mela tells that achilles is buried in the island named achillea between boristhene and ister the greek geographer dionysius periegetus of bithynia who lived at the time of domitian writes that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor the periplus of the euxine sea gives the following details it is said that the goddess thetis raised this island from the sea for her son achilles who dwells there here is his temple and his statue an archaic work this island is not inhabited and goats graze on it not many which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships sacrifice to achilles in this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts craters rings and precious stones offered to achilles in gratitude one can still read inscriptions in greek and latin in which achilles is praised and celebrated some of these are worded in patroclus honor because those who wish to be favored by achilles honor patroclus at the same time there are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds which look after achilles temple every morning they fly out to sea wet their wings with water and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it and after they finish the sprinkling they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings other people say still more that some of the men who reach this island come here intentionally they bring animals in their ships destined to be sacrificed some of these animals they slaughter others they set free on the island in achilles honor but there are others who are forced to come to this island by sea storms as they have no sacrificial animals but wish to get them from the god of the island himself they consult achilles oracle they ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair but in case the oracle denies them permission because there is an oracle here they add something to the price offered and if the oracle refuses again they add something more until at last the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient and then the victim doesn t run away any more but waits willingly to be caught so there is a great quantity of silver there consecrated to the hero as price for the sacrificial victims to some of the people who come to this island achilles appears in dreams to others he would appear even during their navigation if they were not too far away and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships quoted in densu ianu the heroic cult of achilles on leuce island was widespread in antiquity not only along the sea lanes of the pontic sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the black sea achilles from leuce island was venerated as pontarches the lord and master of the pontic sea the protector of sailors and navigation sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice to achilles of leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters achilleion in messenia stephanus byzantinus achilleios in laconia pausanias iii two five four nicolae densu ianu densu ianu one nine one three even though he recognized achilles in the name of aquileia and in the north arm of the danube delta the arm of chilia achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over pontos evokes modern rather than archaic sea law leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing pausanias iii one nine one three reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound ammianus marcellinus xxii eight attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island worship of achilles in modern times the achilleion in corfu in the region of gastouri to the south of the city of corfu greece empress of austria elisabeth of bavaria also known as sissi built in one eight nine zero a summer palace with achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to platonic romanticism the palace naturally was named after achilles achilleion this elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the trojan war other stories achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the achilleion in corfu he gazes northward toward the city the inscription in greek reads i e achilles some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hides the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the red haired girl with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he rapes achilles there fathers a son neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father s possible alias according to this story odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women s clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly takes up the spear odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women flee in panic achilles prepares to defend the court thus giving his identity away in book one one of homer s odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead but achilles then asks odysseus of his son s exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfaction this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life achilles was worshipped as a sea god in many of the greek colonies on the black sea the location of the mythical white island which he was said to inhabit after his death together with many other heroes the kings of the epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy in ad two one six the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus achilles fought and killed the amazon helene some also said he married medea and that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica in some versions of the myth achilles has a relationship with his captive briseis achilles in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo

part of spencer county indiana when the county was established in one eight one eight the farm is preserved as part of the lincoln boyhood national memorial in one eight six zero lincoln noted that

was known for his free soil stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism he first articulated this in one eight three seven saying the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad

the party line lincoln in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua r giddings wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke out against the mexican

adopted would have banned slavery in any u s territory won from mexico lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico and the u s polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it the national papers ignored it and it resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on the presidential war making powers realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency lincoln who had pledged in one eight four six to serve only one term in the house supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the one eight four eight presidential election taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office but that lucrative patronage job went to an illinois rival justin butterfield considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer but in lincoln s view an old fossil the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory this distant territory was a democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice prairie lawyer lincoln in one eight five seven lincoln returned to practicing law in springfield handling every kind of

the illinois central railroad lincoln s reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname honest abe lincoln s most notable criminal trial occurred in one eight five eight when he defended william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case is famous for lincoln s use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness after an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility based on this evidence armstrong was acquitted lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom but in an one eight five nine case where he defended a cousin peachy harrison who was accused of stabbing another to

sandford as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery on october one six one eight five four in his peoria speech lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency speaking in his kentucky accent with a very powerful voice he said the kansas act had a declared indifference but as i must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i cannot but hate it i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world in late one eight five four lincoln ran as a whig for the u s senate seat from illinois at that time senators were elected by the state legislature after leading in the first six rounds of voting in the illinois assembly his support began to dwindle and lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull who defeated opponent joel aldrich matteson the whigs had been irreparably split by the kansas nebraska act lincoln wrote i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery drawing on remnants of the old whig party and on disenchanted free soil liberty

slave state in march one eight five seven the supreme court issued its decision in dred scott v sandford chief justice roger b taney opined that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution lincoln denounced the decision alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power lincoln argued the authors of the declaration of independence never intended to say all were equal in color size intellect moral developments or social capacity but they did consider all men created equal equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness after the state republican party convention nominated him for the u s senate in one eight five eight lincoln delivered his house divided speech drawing on a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas as its u s senator lincoln douglas debates and cooper union speech lincoln in one eight five eight the year of his debates with stephen douglas over slavery the senate campaign featured the seven lincoln douglas debates of one eight five eight the most famous political debates in american history the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands lincoln stated douglas popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation s morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the u s supreme court and the dred scott decision though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected douglas to the senate despite the bitterness of

ground between the right and the wrong despite his inelegant appearance many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience historian donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival s william h seward own state at an event sponsored by the second rival s

six zero presidential nomination and campaign alt lincoln being carried by two men on a long board the rail candidate lincoln s one eight six zero candidacy is depicted as held up by the slavery issue a slave on the left and party organization on the right on may nine one zero one eight six zero the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur lincoln s followers organized a campaign team led by david davis norman judd leonard swett and jesse dubois and lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax lincoln s supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate in one eight six zero lincoln described himself i am in height six feet four inches nearly lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes his biographers added that he had a large head with high crown of skull thick bushy hair large and deep eye caverns heavy eyebrows a large nose large ears large mouth thin upper and somewhat thick under lip very high and prominent cheek bones cheeks thin and sunken strongly developed jawbone chin slightly upturned a thin but sinewy neck rather long long arms large hands chest thin and narrow as compared with his great height legs of more than proportionate length and large feet on may one eight at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln s friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as william h seward and salmon p chase a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket lincoln s success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff on the third ballot pennsylvania put him over the top pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs lincoln s managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others while following lincoln s strong dictate to make no contracts that bind me most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government with the dred scott decision and the presidency of james buchanan throughout the one eight five zero s lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession meanwhile douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from one one slave states walked out of the democratic convention disagreeing with douglas position on popular sovereignty and ultimately selected john c breckinridge as their candidate the wide awake parade was formed in one eight six zero by republicans in the northern states to help nominate abraham lincoln as the president of the united states as lincoln s ideas of abolishing slavery grew so did his supporters people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln because of his ideas of anti slavery and took action to rally supporters for lincoln as douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches instead he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln s life story emphasizing his childhood poverty the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts the republican party s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincoln s life and sold one zero zero zero zero zero to two zero zero zero zero zero copies presidency one eight six zero election and secession on november six one eight six zero lincoln was elected the one six th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a douglas john c breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party he was the first president from the republican party his victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the north and west no ballots were cast for him in one zero of the one five southern slave states and he won only two of nine nine six counties in all the southern states lincoln received one eight six six four five two votes douglas one three seven six nine five seven votes breckinridge eight four nine seven eight one votes and bell five eight eight seven eight nine votes turnout was eight two two percent with lincoln winning the free northern states as well as california and oregon douglas won missouri and split new jersey with lincoln bell won virginia tennessee and kentucky and breckinridge won the rest of the south although lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had one eight zero and his opponents added together had only one two three there were fusion tickets in which all of lincoln s opponents combined to support the same slate of electors in new york new jersey and rhode island but even if the anti lincoln vote had been combined in every state lincoln still would have won a majority in the electoral college the first photographic image of the new president as lincoln s election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the union before he took office the next march on december two zero one eight six zero south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february one one eight six one florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america the upper south and border states delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february nine one eight six one there were attempts at compromise the crittenden compromise would have extended the missouri compromise line of one eight two zero dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the republican party s free soil platform lincoln rejected the idea saying i will suffer death before i consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that congress would not interfere with slavery without southern consent a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution en route to his inauguration by train lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north the president elect then evaded possible assassins in baltimore who were uncovered by lincoln s head of security allan pinkerton on february two three one eight six one he arrived in disguise in washington d c which was placed under substantial military guard lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature the failure of the peace conference of one eight six one signaled that legislative compromise was impossible by march one eight six one no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated lincoln said as the war was ending both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came beginning of the war alt portrait major anderson ft sumter commander the commander of fort sumter south carolina major robert anderson sent a request for provisions to washington and the execution of lincoln s order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war on april one two one eight six one confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war historian donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that on april one five lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling seven five zero zero zero troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states this call forced the states to choose sides virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital despite the exposed position of richmond so close to union lines north carolina tennessee and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky tried to be neutral the confederate attack on fort sumter rallied americans north of the mason dixon line to the defense of the american nation historian allan nevins says the thunderclap of sumter produced a startling crystallization of northern sentiment anger swept the land from every side came news of mass meetings speeches resolutions tenders of business support the muster of companies and regiments the determined action of governors and legislatures states sent union regiments south in response to lincoln s call to save the capital and confront the rebellion on april one nine mobs in baltimore which controlled the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains and local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital the army responded by arresting local maryland officials lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington john merryman a maryland official involved in hindering the u s troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander roger b taney author of the controversial pro slavery dred scott opinion to issue a writ of habeas corpus and in june taney acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court issued the writ because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling assuming command for the union in the war after the battle of fort sumter lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commander in chief using unprecedented powers he expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress and after suspending habeas corpus arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions in addition lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict alt a group of men sitting at a table as another man creates money on a wooden machine running the machine an one eight six four political cartoon takes a swing at lincoln s administration featuring william fessenden edwin stanton william seward gideon welles lincoln and others the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln and dominated his time and attention from the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue conversely the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery on august six one eight six one lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort in practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy in late august one eight six one general john c fr mont the one eight five six republican presidential nominee issued without consulting his superiors in washington a proclamation of martial law in missouri he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court martialed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed fr mont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption lincoln overruled fr mont s proclamation lincoln believed that fremont s emancipation was political neither militarily necessary nor legal after lincoln acted union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over four zero zero zero zero troops lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his secretary of state william seward at times seward was too bellicose so for balance lincoln stuck a close working relationship with senator charles sumner the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee the trent affair of late one eight six one threatened war with great britain the u s navy had illegally intercepted a british mail ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the u s cheered lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats biographer james g randall has dissected lincoln s successful techniques his restraint his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence his early softening of state department s attitude toward britain his deference toward seward and sumner his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion his readiness to arbitrate his golden silence in addressing congress his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for america s true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the war department headquarters he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success as well as their state and party in january one eight six two after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary stanton was a staunchly unionist pro business conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman in terms of war strategy lincoln articulated two priorities to ensure that washington was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt decisive victory major northern newspaper editors expected victory within nine zero days twice a week lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff general henry halleck a disciple of the european strategist jomini he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing territory general mcclellan after the union defeat at the first battle of bull run and the retirement of the aged winfield scott in late one eight six one lincoln appointed major general george b mcclellan general in chief of all the union armies mcclellan a young west point graduate railroad executive and pennsylvania democrat took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign longer than lincoln wanted the campaign s objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital mcclellan s repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan s troops in defense of the capital mcclellan who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign alt photograph of lincoln and mcclellan sitting at a table in a field tent lincoln and george mcclellan after the battle of antietam in one eight six two lincoln removed mcclellan as general in chief in march one eight six two after mcclellan s harrison s landing letter in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort the office remained empty until july when henry halleck was selected for it mcclellan s letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia pope complied with lincoln s strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack however lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan now commanding the army of the potomac pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of one eight six two forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time the war also expanded with naval operations in one eight six two when the css virginia formerly the uss merrimack damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk virginia before being engaged and damaged by the uss monitor lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan s failure to reinforce pope lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward two days after mcclellan s return to command general robert e lee s forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam in september one eight six two the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january having composed the proclamation some time earlier lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation mcclellan then resisted the president s demand that he pursue lee s retreating and exposed army while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee as a result lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the one eight six two midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander in chief union soldiers before marye s heights fredericksburg just prior to the battle of may three one eight six three burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined desertions during one eight six three were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg lincoln brought in joseph hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship the mid term elections in one eight six two brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of habeas corpus the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest while republicans were discouraged democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania ohio indiana and new york the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states except new york the cincinnati gazette contended that the voters were depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress in the spring of one eight six three lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together these plans included hooker s attack on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant s on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may but continued to command his troops for some weeks he ignored lincoln s order to divide his troops and possibly force lee to do the same in harper s ferry and tendered his resignation which lincoln accepted he was replaced by george meade who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign which was a victory for the union though lee s army avoided capture at the same time after initial setbacks grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor after the battle of gettysburg lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general in chief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander in chief emancipation proclamation lincoln presents the first draft of the emancipation proclamation to his cabinet painted by francis bicknell carpenter in one eight six four alt a dark haired bearded middle aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men lincoln understood that the federal government s power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before one eight six five committed the issue to individual states he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new u s territory at the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the founding fathers under the constitution president lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by major general john c fr mont in august one eight six one and by major general david hunter in may one eight six two on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the union on june one nine one eight six two endorsed by lincoln congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory in july the confiscation act of one eight six two was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion although lincoln believed it was not within congress s power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature he felt such action could only be taken by the commander in chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution and lincoln was planning to take that action in that month lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet in it he stated that as a fit and necessary military measure on january one one eight six three all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free privately lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated however copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential new york tribune fell for the ploy and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august two two one eight six two although he said he personally wished all men could be free lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the u s president he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his official duty was that of preserving the union the emancipation proclamation issued on september two two one eight six two and put into effect on january one one eight six three declared free the slaves in one zero states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states lincoln spent the next one zero zero days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters in the one eight six two off year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed lincoln s comment on the signing of the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed a few days after emancipation was announced one three republican governors met at the war governors conference they supported the president s proclamation but suggested the removal of general george b mcclellan as commander of the union army enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation by the spring of one eight six three lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers in a letter to andrew johnson the military governor of tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of five zero zero zero zero armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once by the end of one eight six three at lincoln s direction general lorenzo thomas had recruited two zero regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley frederick douglass once observed of lincoln in his company i was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color gettysburg address one eight six three the only confirmed photo of abraham lincoln at gettysburg some three hours before the speech with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july one eight six three and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the new york city draft riots the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november one nine one eight six three defying lincoln s prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history in two seven two words and three minutes lincoln asserted the nation was born not in one seven eight nine but in one seven seven six conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective a new birth of freedom in the nation general grant alt painting of four men conferring in a ship s cabin entitled the peacemakers president lincoln center right with from left generals sherman and grant and admiral porter one eight six eight painting of events aboard the river queen in march one eight six five meade s failure to capture lee s army as it retreated from gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln that a change in command was needed general ulysses s grant s victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant a strong candidate to head the union army responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i can t spare this man he fights with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops nevertheless lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in one eight six four as mcclellan was lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant s political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the senate grant s promotion to commander of the union army he obtained congress s consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general which no officer had held since george washington grant waged his bloody overland campaign in one eight six four this is often characterized as a war of attrition given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the confederate forces had almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north grant had lost a third of his army and lincoln asked what grant s plans were to which the general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer the confederacy lacked reinforcements so lee s army shrank with every costly battle grant s army moved south crossed the james river forcing a siege and trench warfare outside petersburg virginia lincoln then made an extended visit to grant s headquarters at city point virginia this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north and replaced the union losses lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure such as plantations railroads and bridges hoping to destroy the south s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting grant s move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginia s shenandoah valley the damage caused by sherman s march to the sea through georgia in one eight six four was limited to a swath but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the confederate armies mark e neely jr has argued that there was no effort to engage in total war against civilians which he believed did take place during world war ii confederate general jubal anderson early began a series of assaults in the north that threatened the capital during early s raid on washington d c in one eight six four lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot after repeated calls on grant to defend washington sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched as grant continued to wear down lee s forces efforts to discuss peace began confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results on april one one eight six five grant successfully outflanked lee s forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg and the confederate government evacuated richmond days later when that city fell lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital as he walked through the city white southerners were stone faced but freedmen greeted him as a hero on april nine lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over one eight six four re election while the war was still being waged lincoln faced reelection in one eight six four lincoln was a master politician bringing together and holding together all the main factions of the republican party and bringing in war democrats such as edwin m stanton and andrew johnson as well lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers greatly expanded over peacetime to hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by radicals to drop him from the one eight six four ticket at its one eight six four convention the republican party selected johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party when grant s one eight six four spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the president s re election prospects and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated sharing this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort sherman s capture of atlanta in september and david farragut s capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln by contrast the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads on november eight lincoln was re elected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving seven eight percent of the union soldiers vote on march four one eight six five lincoln delivered his second inaugural address in it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be god s will historian mark noll concludes it ranks among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world lincoln said reconstruction reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves shortly after lee s surrender a general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated and lincoln replied let em up easy in keeping with that sentiment lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radical republicans under rep thaddeus stevens sen charles sumner and sen benjamin wade political allies of the president on other issues determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war his amnesty proclamation of december eight one eight six three offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance alt cartoon of lincoln and johnson attempting to stitch up the broken union a political cartoon of vice president andrew johnson a former tailor and lincoln one eight six five entitled the rail splitter at work repairing the union the caption reads johnson take it quietly uncle abe and i will draw it closer than ever lincoln a few more stitches andy and the good old union will be mended as southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re formed of special importance were tennessee and arkansas where lincoln appointed generals andrew johnson and frederick steele as military governors respectively in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when one zero percent of the voters agreed to it lincoln s democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations on the other hand the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill in one eight six four when lincoln vetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee lincoln s appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness to fill chief justice taney s seat on the supreme court he named the choice of the radicals salmon p chase who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies after implementing the emancipation proclamation which did not apply to every state lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment lincoln declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter by december one eight six three a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required two thirds majority on june one five one eight six four in the house of representatives passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican unionist platform in the election of one eight six four after a long debate in the house a second attempt passed congress on january three one one eight six five and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification upon ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december six one eight six five as the war drew to a close lincoln s presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen he signed into law senator charles sumner s freedmen s bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction shortly before his assassination lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short term military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern unionists historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen lincoln biographers james g randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that it is likely that had he lived lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnson s that he would have clashed with congressional radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnson s mistakes eric foner argues that unlike sumner and other radicals lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land he believed as most republicans did in april one eight six five that the voting requirements should be determined by the states he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists reluctant secessionists and forward looking former confederates but time and again during the war lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death redefining the republic and republicanism upright alt an older tired looking abraham lincoln with a beard lincoln in february one eight six five about two months before his death the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the one nine th century in recent years historians such as harry jaffa herman belz john diggins vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln s redefinition of republican values as early as the one eight five zero s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values what he called the sheet anchor of republicanism the declaration s emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the constitution s tolerance of slavery shifted the debate as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early one eight six zero lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms nevertheless in one eight six one lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state burton two zero zero eight argues that lincoln s republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated in march one eight six one in lincoln s first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people other enactments lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress the only important one was the wade davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction he signed the homestead act in one eight six two making millions of acres of government held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost the morrill land grant colleges act also signed in one eight six two provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state the pacific railway acts of one eight six two and one eight six four granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in one eight six nine the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the one eight five zero s other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs a policy with long precedent and a new federal income tax in one eight six one lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff the first having become law under james buchanan also in one eight six one lincoln signed the revenue act of one eight six one creating the first u s income tax this created a flat tax of three percent on incomes above eight zero zero in current dollar terms which was later changed by the revenue act of one eight six two to a progressive rate structure lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government s economic influence in several other areas the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided a strong financial network in the country it also established a national currency in one eight six two congress created with lincoln s approval the department of agriculture in one eight six two lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota presented with three zero three execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving three nine for execution one was later reprieved president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy in the wake of grant s casualties in his campaign against lee lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued in response to rumors of one however the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market lincoln s reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior he ordered the military to seize the two papers the seizure lasted for two days lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states before lincoln s presidency thanksgiving while a regional holiday in new england since the one seven th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates the last such proclamation had been during james madison s presidency five zero years before in one eight six three lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving in june one eight six four lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park judicial appointments supreme court appointments noah haynes swayne one eight six two samuel freeman miller one eight six two david davis one eight six two stephen johnson field one eight six three salmon portland chase one eight six four chief justice salmon portland chase was lincoln s choice to be chief justice of the united states lincoln s declared philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court noah haynes swayne nominated january two one one eight six two and appointed january two four one eight six two was chosen as an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the union samuel freeman miller nominated and appointed on july one six one eight six two supported lincoln in the one eight six zero election and was an avowed abolitionist david davis lincoln s campaign manager in one eight six zero nominated december one one eight six two and appointed december eight one eight six two had also served as a judge in lincoln s illinois court circuit stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice was nominated march six one eight six three and appointed march one zero one eight six three and provided geographic balance as well as political balance to the court as a democrat finally lincoln s treasury secretary salmon p chase was nominated as chief justice and appointed the same day on december six one eight six four lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party other judicial appointments lincoln appointed three two federal judges including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states and two seven judges to the united states district courts lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit courts during his time in office states admitted to the union west virginia admitted to the union june two zero one eight six three contained the former north westernmost counties of

drawing to a close the assassination occurred five days after the surrender of robert e lee and the confederate army of northern virginia booth was a well known actor and a confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service in one eight six four booth formulated a plan very similar to one of thomas n conrad previously authorized by the confederacy to kidnap lincoln in exchange for the release of confederate prisoners after attending an april one one one eight six five speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks an incensed booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president learning that the president and grant would be attending ford s theatre booth formulated a plan with co conspirators to assassinate lincoln and grant at the theater as well as vice president johnson and secretary of state seward at their homes without his main bodyguard ward hill lamon lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april one four at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play lincoln s bodyguard john parker left ford s theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door the now unguarded president sat in his state box in the balcony seizing the opportunity booth crept up from behind and at about one zero one three pm aimed at the back of lincoln s head and fired at point blank range mortally wounding the president major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped after being on the run for one two days booth was tracked down and found on a farm in virginia some south of washington after refusing to surrender to union troops booth was killed by sergeant boston corbett on april two six doctor charles leale an army surgeon found the president unresponsive barely breathing and with no detectable pulse having determined that the president had been shot in the head and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought he made an attempt to clear the blood clot after which the president began to breathe more naturally the dying president was taken across the street to petersen house after remaining in a coma for nine hours lincoln died at seven two two am on april one five secretary of war stanton saluted and said now he belongs to the ages lincoln s flag enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the white house by bareheaded union officers while the city s church bells rang president johnson was sworn in at one zero zero zero am less than three hours after lincoln s death the late president lay in state in the east room and then in the capitol rotunda from april one nine through april two one for his final journey with his son willie both caskets were transported in the executive coach united states and for three weeks the lincoln special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore lincoln s remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from washington d c to springfield illinois stopping at many cities across the north for large scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom d to eulogize lincoln one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but also noted that some lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news african americans were especially moved they had lost their moses in a larger sense the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended religious and philosophical beliefs upright alt a painting of lincoln sitting with his hand on his chin and his elbow on his leg lincoln painting by george peter alexander healy in one eight six nine as a young man lincoln was a religious skeptic or in the words of a biographer an iconoclast later in life lincoln s frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants he never joined a church although he frequently attended with his wife however he was deeply familiar with the bible and he both quoted and praised it he was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others lincoln never made a clear profession of christian beliefs however he did believe in an all powerful god that shaped events and by one eight six five was expressing those beliefs in major speeches in the one eight four zero s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power in the one eight five zero s lincoln believed in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence when he suffered the death of his son edward lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on god the death of his son willie in february one eight six two may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace after willie s death lincoln considered why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest yet the contest began and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day yet the contest proceeds on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land health several claims abound that lincoln s health was declining before the assassination these are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting one such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder men two b which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid appearance others simply claim he had marfan s syndrome based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers and the association of possible aortic regurgitation which can cause bobbing of the head demusset s sign based on blurring of lincoln s head

study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after washington in presidential ranking polls conducted in the united states since one nine four eight lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls schlesinger one nine four eight schlesinger one nine six two one nine eight two murray blessing survey

three presidents are rated as one lincoln two george washington and three franklin d roosevelt although lincoln and washington and washington and roosevelt are occasionally reversed president lincoln s assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty republicans linked lincoln s name to their party many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability schwartz argues that lincoln s reputation grew slowly in the late one nine th century until the progressive era one nine zero zero one nine two zero s when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in american history with even white southerners in agreement the high point came in one nine two two with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington d c in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state in the cold war years lincoln s image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes by the one nine seven zero s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks internal improvements and railroads in opposition to the agrarian democrats william c harris found that lincoln s reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism james g randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders by the late one nine six zero s liberals such as historian lerone bennett were having second thoughts especially regarding lincoln s views on racial issues bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in one nine six eight he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs told jokes that ridiculed blacks insisted he opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation historian barry schwartz wrote in two zero zero nine that lincoln s image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late two zero th century on the other hand donald opined in his one nine nine six biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason today s u s president however seems to be promoting a sympathetic resurgence for his predecessor lincoln indeed president obama has insisted on using lincoln s bible for his swearing in of office at both his inaugurations lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light memory and memorials alt an aerial photo a large white building with big pillars lincoln memorial in washington d c lincoln s portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny and the five bill his likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of nebraska the most famous and most visited memorials are lincoln s sculpture on mount rushmore lincoln memorial ford s theatre and petersen house where he died in washington d c and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum in springfield illinois not far from lincoln s home as well as his tomb there was also the great moments with mr lincoln exhibit in disneyland and the hall of presidents at walt disney world which had to do with walt disney admiring lincoln ever since he was a little boy barry schwartz a sociologist who has examined america s cultural memory argues that in the one nine three zero s and one nine four zero s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the world s disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful franklin d roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan americans asked what would lincoln do however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincoln s symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness

interests notable ideas influences influenced aristotle aristot l s three eight four three two two bc was a greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira chalkidice on the northern periphery of classical greece his father nicomachus died when aristotle was a child whereafter proxenus of atarneus became his guardian at eighteen he joined plato s academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven c three four seven bc his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theater music rhetoric linguistics politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip of macedon tutored alexander the great starting from three four three bc according to the encyclop dia britannica aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history and every scientist is in his debt teaching alexander the great gave aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies he established a library in the lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books the fact that aristotle was a pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism but following plato s death aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism he believed all peoples concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception aristotle s views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works aristotle s views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics some of aristotle s zoological observations such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were not confirmed or refuted until the one nine th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic which was incorporated in the late one nine th century into modern formal logic in metaphysics aristotelianism profoundly influenced judeo islamic philosophical and theological thought during the middle ages and continues to influence christian theology especially the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was well known among medieval muslim intellectuals and revered as the first teacher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics all aspects of aristotle s philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues cicero described his literary style as a river of gold it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived life school of aristotle in mieza macedonia greece aristotle whose name means the best purpose was born in three eight four bc in stagira chalcidice about five five km three four miles east of modern day thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon although there is little information on aristotle s childhood he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy at about the age of eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato s academy he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in three four eight four seven bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy s direction after control passed to plato s nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared anti macedonian sentiments and left before plato died aristotle by francesco hayez one seven nine one one eight eight two aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor there he traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island aristotle married pythias either hermias s adoptive daughter or niece she bore him a daughter whom they also named pythias soon after hermias death aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander in three four three bc aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by three three five bc artistotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus according to the suda he also had an eromenos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between three three five and three two three bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time but made significant contributions to most of them in physical science aristotle studied anatomy astronomy embryology geography geology meteorology physics and zoology in philosophy he wrote on aesthetics ethics government metaphysics politics economics psychology rhetoric and theology he also studied education foreign customs literature and poetry his combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander s relationship with persia and persians a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander s death but there is little evidence following alexander s death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in three two two bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother s family estate in chalcis at which occasion he was said to have stated i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to athens s prior trial and execution of socrates he died in euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife charles walston argues that the tomb of aristotle is located on the sacred way between chalcis and eretria and to have contained two styluses a pen a signet ring and some terra cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of aristotle in the form of some skull fragments in general the details of the life of aristotle are not well established the biographies of aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points thought logic upright aristotle portrayed in the one four nine three nuremberg chronicle as a scholar of the one five th century ad with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until one nine th century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason that aristotle s theory of logic completely accounted for the core of deductive inference history aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of however plato reports that syntax was devised before him by prodicus of ceos who was concerned by the correct use of words logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications even plato had difficulties with logic although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system he could never actually construct one thus he relied instead on his dialectic plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow consequently plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial he never succeeded in devising such a method but his best attempt was published in his book sophist where he introduced his division method analytics and the organon what we today call aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have labeled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle s work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early one st century ce categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle s writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning there is one volume of aristotle s concerning logic not found in the organon namely the fourth book of metaphysics aristotle s epistemology plato left and aristotle right a detail of the school of athens a fresco by raphael aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience while holding a copy of his nicomachean ethics in his hand whilst plato gestures to the heavens representing his belief in the forms while holding a copy of timaeus like his teacher plato aristotle s philosophy aims at the universal aristotle s ontology however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while in plato s ontology the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or for aristotle therefore epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences while for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these for aristotle form still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is instantiated in a particular substance see universals and particulars below in a certain sense aristotle s method is both inductive and deductive while plato s is essentially deductive from a priori principles in aristotle s terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences in modern times the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays a major role today s philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method in contrast aristotle s philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry in the larger sense of the word aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics one zero two five b two five by practical science he means ethics and politics by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics if logic or analytics is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of one logic two theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics and mathematics three practical philosophy and four poetical philosophy in the period between his two stays in athens between his times at the academy and the lyceum aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today in fact most of aristotle s life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science aristotle s metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics he did however perform original research in the natural sciences e g botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences aristotle s writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative beginning in the one six th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and aristotle s work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature he had a conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers his writings provide an account of many scientific observations a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors for example in his history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females in a similar vein john philoponus and later galileo showed by simple experiments that aristotle s theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect on the other hand aristotle refuted democritus s claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun s rays pointing out correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time that given current astronomical demonstrations that the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them in places aristotle goes too far in deriving laws of the universe from simple observation and over stretched reason today s scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective and that discerning the validity of one s hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which aristotle used to support his laws aristotle also had some scientific blind spots he posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics which was widely accepted up until the one six th century from the three rd century to the one six th century the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational center of the universe because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance these thinkers often took aristotle s erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch however aristotle s scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields for instance he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants geology as quoted from principles of geology he aristotle refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer to the shallowing of the palus maeotis within sixty years from his own time he alludes to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption the changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten he says one two th chapter of his meteorics the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system and within a certain period the concluding observation is as follows as time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the tanais nor the nile can have flowed for ever the places where they rise were once dry and there is a limit to their operations but there is none to time so also of all other rivers they spring up and they perish and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts therefore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time physics five elements aristotle proposed a fifth element aether in addition to the four proposed earlier by empedocles earth which is cold and dry this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid water which is cold and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid air which is hot and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas fire which is hot and dry this corresponds to the modern ideas of plasma and heat aether which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies stars and planets each of the four earthly elements has its natural place all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe i e the center of the earth water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere fire tends toward the lunar sphere in which the moon orbits when elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it this is natural motion motion requiring no extrinsic cause so for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up in air rain falls and flame rises outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles motion aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality as such aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential as a transition toward a potentially possible state because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the as such to the definition is critical to understanding it causality the four causes aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of a table is wood and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel it is not about action it does not mean one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form i e the arrangement of that matter it tells us what a thing is that any thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole i e macrostructure is the cause of its parts a relationship known as the whole part causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor and in the second place as intrinsic determining cause embodied in the matter formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation a simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create his drawings the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs so take the two dominoes this time of equal weighting the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over the final cause is its purpose or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition need desire ethics or spiritual beliefs additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect moreover aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absence may result in different outcomes simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino because it cannot fall of its own accord aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation all causes proper and incidental can be spoken as potential or as actual particular or generic the same language refers to the effects of causes so that generic effects assigned to generic causes particular effects to particular causes operating causes to actual effects essentially causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect optics aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day the second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura after mozi c four zero zero bc can be found in aristotle s documentation of such a device in three five zero bc in problemata aristotle s apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole or aperture to allow for sunlight to enter aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object in modern cameras this is analogous to the diaphragm aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things it is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance for a better understanding of aristotle s conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place for example a person seeks donations that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum however if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance it must be unusual that something happens by chance in other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that can only apply to human beings because it is in the sphere of moral actions according to aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance metaphysics aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of immaterial being or of being in the highest degree of abstraction he refers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science substance potentiality and actuality aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence ousia in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia see also predicables that let us define something as a house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption three one nine b three two zero a he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do for that for the sake of which a thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired for animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance i e matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same thing universals and particulars aristotle s predecessor plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze a form of an apple in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple moreover we can place an apple next to a book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form bertrand russell is a two zero th century philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of uninstantiated universals aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things according to aristotle if a universal exists either as a particular or a relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated consequently according to aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals as plato spoke of the world of the forms a location where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms biology and medicine in aristotelian science especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition he dissected animals but not humans his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded empirical research program octopus swimming torpedo fuscomaculata leopard shark aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas the works that reflect this research such as history of animals generation of animals and parts of animals contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes the most striking passages are about the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen his observations on catfish electric fish torpedo and angler fish are detailed as is his writing on cephalopods namely octopus sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus argonauta argo his description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the one nine th century he separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selach selachians another good example of his methods comes from the generation of animals in which aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated he gave accurate descriptions of ruminants four chambered fore stomachs and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus mustelus classification of living things aristotle distinguished about five zero zero species of birds mammals and fishes his classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the one nine th century what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of hemoglobin but of a different kind from vertebrates animals with blood were divided into live bearing mammals and egg bearing birds and fish invertebrates animals without blood are insects crustacea divided into non shelled cephalopods and shelled and testacea molluscs in some respects this incomplete classification is better than that of linnaeus who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups insecta and vermes worms for charles singer nothing is more remarkable than aristotle s efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as a scala naturae aristotle s history of animals classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical ladder of life scala naturae or great chain of being placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move aristotle believed that intellectual purposes i e final causes guided all natural processes such a teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and a single hooved animal with two horns i have never seen aristotle suggested that nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with nature trying to preserve a type of balance in a similar fashion aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man the scala naturae his system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs aristotle also held that the level of a creature s perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times he placed emphasis on the type s of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans a vegetative a sensitive and a rational soul capable of thought and reflection aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotle s division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon successor theophrastus the frontispiece to a one six four four version of the expanded and illustrated edition of historia plantarum ca one two zero zero which was originally written around three zero zero bc aristotle s successor at the lyceum theophrastus wrote a series of books on botany the history of plants which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the middle ages many of theophrastus names survive into modern times such as carpos for fruit and pericarpion for seed vessel rather than focus on formal causes as aristotle did theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on aristotle s concept of the efficient cause theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages influence on hellenistic medicine after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotle s ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the one eight th and one nine th centuries ernst mayr claimed that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance aristotle s ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly psychology aristotle s psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psyche often known by its latin title de anima posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have a rational soul this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them for aristotle the soul psyche was a simpler concept than it is for us today by soul he simply meant the form of a living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings e g the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement memory according to aristotle memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words a memory is a mental picture in which aristotle defines in de anima as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory aristotle believed an imprint becomes impressed on a semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory a memory occurs when a stimuli is too complex that the nervous system semi fluid bodily organ cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation common sense and thinking the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard every experience ends up as a mental image in memory aristotle uses the word memory for two basic abilities first the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic imprint that can develop from sensation second the intellectual anxiety that comes with the imprint due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time therefore memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present the retrieval of our imprints cannot be performed suddenly a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience aristotle proposed that slow witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the imprint can easily continue however they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new imprints he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an imprint young people undergo rapid changes as they develop while the elderly s organs are beginning to decay thus stunting new imprints likewise people who are too quick witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ because intellectual functions are not involved in memory memories belong to some animals too but only those in which have perception of time recollection because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or imprints people are continually weaving together new imprints of things they experience in order to search for these imprints people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the other if the chain of images is not needed but expected then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed recollection is the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory imprint after some time has passed retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being human or animal and the abilities the human or animal possesses only humans will remember imprints of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed recollection of an imprint is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences when an imprint is recalled it may bring forth a large group of related imprints aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain imprints was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships similarity contrast and contiguity these three laws make up his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams sleep before understanding aristotle s take on dreams first his idea of sleep must be examined aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body including the senses so it can be revitalized while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire which is the result of a sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences also all of the senses are not inactive during sleep only the ones that are weary theory of dreams dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because as discussed the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner than when awake aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water when they look away from that stimulus the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant however during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings when a person is asleep their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams when asleep a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their dream this in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not so the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it one component of aristotle s theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine being aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations these ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not he claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream the actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake practical philosophy ethics aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study i e one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuch normally translated as soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character thik aret often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher politics aristotle s classification of constitutions in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be a natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he also famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and also arguing that humanity s defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotle s conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotle s understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership koin nia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences excerpt from a speech by the character aristotle in the book protrepticus hutchinson and johnson two zero one five p two two for we all agree that the most excellent man should rule i e the supreme by nature and that the law rules and alone is authoritative but the law is a kind of intelligence i e a discourse based on intelligence and again what standard do we have what criterion of good things that is more precise than the intelligent man for all that this man will choose if the choice is based on his knowledge are good things and their contraries are bad and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions a just man choosing to live justly a man with bravery to live bravely likewise a self controlled man to live with self control it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent for this is the function of that capacity hence it s evident that according to the most authoritative judgment intelligence is supreme among goods rhetoric and poetics aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative each varying in imitation by medium object and manner for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind s advantages over animals while it is believed that aristotle s poetics comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotle s analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to women s happiness as he did to men s and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men loss and preservation of his works first page of a one five six six edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin modern scholarship reveals that aristotle s lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication the surviving works do not appear to have been so rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication the authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect with some books duplicating or summarizing each other the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotle s at all some of the individual works within the corpus including the constitution of athens are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotle s school perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision others such as on colors may have been produced by aristotle s successors at the lyceum e g theophrastus and straton still others acquired aristotle s name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the de plantis possibly by nicolaus of damascus other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and self promotional according to a distinction that originates with aristotle himself his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric and the esoteric most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works aristotle intended for the public exoteric and the more technical works intended for use within the lyceum course school esoteric modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotle s own unpolished lecture notes or in some cases possible notes by his students however one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation the five th century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes that aristotle s writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant that all of aristotle s extant writings are of the esoteric kind current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious though many of them may have been in dialogue form fragments of some of aristotle s dialogues have survived perhaps it is to these that cicero refers when he characterized aristotle s writing style as a river of gold it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us however some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that cicero s praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotle s extant works originally published in one major question in the history of aristotle s works then is how were the exoteric writings all lost and how did the ones we now possess come to us the story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his parallel lives the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus who in turn willed them to neleus of scepsis neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to scepsis where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the one st century bc when apellicon of teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts bringing them back to athens according to the story apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts stay in the basement introducing a number of errors into the text when lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens in eight six bc he carried off the library of apellicon to rome where they were first published in six zero bc by the grammarian tyrannion of amisus and then by the philosopher andronicus of rhodes carnes lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing aristotelianism during the first century b c lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story however first the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicon s inexpert attempt at repair second there is incontrovertible evidence lord says that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis third the definitive edition of aristotle s texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his and fourth ancient library catalogues predating andronicus intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess lord sees a number of post aristotelian interpolations in the politics for example but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact on the one hand the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts but rather from working drafts used within aristotle s school as opposed on the other hand to the dialogues and other exoteric texts which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle s school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today legacy aristotle by jusepe de ribera aristotle with a bust of homer by rembrandt an thirteenth century

remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method despite these achievements the influence of aristotle s errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably bertrand russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell also refers to aristotle s ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle s work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotle s notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion meno mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotle s influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle s geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men s common property influence on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were john philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle s views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena influence on islamic theologians aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy in accordance with the greek theorists the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher the author of a closed system and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo platonic metaphysical ideas influence on western christian theologians with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from c ad six zero zero to c one one zero zero except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after thomas aquinas wrote his theology working from moerbeke s translations the demand for aristotle s writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance aristotle is referred to as the philosopher by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas see summa theologica part i question three etc these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having at his beddes heed twenty bookes clad in blak or reed of aristotle and his philosophie the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the first circles of hell i saw the master there of those who know amid the philosophic family by all admired and by all reverenced there plato too i saw and socrates who stood beside him closer than the rest vidi l maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia tutti lo miran tutti onor li fanno quivi vid o socrate e platone che nnanzi a li altri pi presso li stanno dante l inferno hell canto iv lines one three one one three five post enlightenment thinkers the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle however debatable this is aristotle rigid separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it is martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as a major influence on her thinking more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans list of works the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are

paris is a jazz influenced symphonic poem by the american composer george gershwin written in one nine two eight inspired by the time gershwin had spent in paris it evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the one nine two zero s and is one of his best known compositions gershwin composed an american in paris on commission from the conductor walter damrosch he scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns he brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december one three one nine two eight in carnegie hall with damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic gershwin completed the orchestration on november one eight less than four weeks before the work s premiere gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer deems taylor noting that my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere when the tone poem moves into the blues our american friend has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness but nostalgia is not a fatal disease the american visitor once again is an alert spectator of parisian life and the street noises and french atmosphere are triumphant background gershwin was attracted by maurice ravel s unusual chords after transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether ravel took students and how much he charged ravel looked at gershwin s prior year earnings and sent a telegram to gershwin jokingly saying he ravel should study with gershwin but he accepted him as a student gershwin went to paris in one nine two six ready to study and to enjoy his first trip to paris after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories ravel said he couldn t teach him but he would send a letter referring him to nadia boulanger while the studies were cut short that one nine two six trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as a thank you note to gershwin s hosts robert and mabel shirmer gershwin called it a rapsodic ballet written so freely and much more modern than his prior works gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour something ravel had been reluctant to do to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravel s friend robert schmitz a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the u s schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco american musical relations and was able to offer ravel a one two zero zero zero fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel gershwin greeted ravel in new york in february one nine two eight at the start of ravel s u s tour and joined ravel again later in the tour in los angeles after a lunch together with chaplin in beverly hills ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled house concert in a friend s music salon performing among kindred spirits ravel s tour reignited gershwin s desire to return to paris which he did in march one nine two eight ravel s high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after playing for her she told him she could not teach him nadia boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students don t copy others be yourself in this case why try to be a second rate ravel when you are already a first rate gershwin this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w b yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso composition gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in one nine two six on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer he described the piece as a rhapsodic ballet because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose aba format gershwin s first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns the b section s andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve bar blues in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso instrumentation an american in paris is scored for three flutes three rd doubling on piccolo two oboes english horn two clarinets in b flat bass clarinet in b flat two bassoons four horns in f three trumpets in b flat three trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta four taxi horns labeled as a b c and d with circles around them alto saxophone soprano saxophone tenor saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone baritone saxophone soprano saxophone alto saxophone and strings although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a b c and d it has recently come to light that gershwin s intention was to have used the notes a four b four d five and a four it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a b c and d with circles he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played the revised edition by f campbell watson calls for three saxophones alto tenor and baritone in this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments william daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in one nine two nine response gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch s interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damrosch s sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his lukewarm concerto in f some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers c sar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere gershwin responded to the critics it s not a beethoven symphony you know it s a humorous piece nothing solemn about it it s not intended to draw tears if it pleases symphony audiences as a light jolly piece a series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds preservation status on september two two two zero one three it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan are working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin s true intent it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster one two bar blues section or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during gershwin s composition process the score to an american in paris is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released the entire project may take three zero to four zero years to complete but an american in paris will be an early volume in the series two urtext editions of the work have been published by the german publisher b note music in two zero one five the changes made by campbell watson have been withdrawn in both editions in the extended urtext one two zero bars of music have been re integrated conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance recordings first recording an american in paris has been frequently recorded the first recording was made for rca victor in one nine two nine with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a flat b flat a higher c and a lower d the radio broadcast of the september eight one nine three seven hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in one nine nine eight in a two cd set arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music in one nine four five arturo toscanini and the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the music in carnegie hall one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer the seattle symphony also recorded a version in one nine nine zero of gershwin

commonly known by its nickname oscar the awards first presented in one nine two nine at the hollywood roosevelt hotel are overseen by ampas the awards ceremony was first broadcast to radio in one nine three zero and televised in one nine five three it is now seen live in more than two zero zero countries and can be streamed live online the oscars is the oldest entertainment awards ceremony its

people the post awards party was held at the mayfair hotel the cost of guest tickets for that night s ceremony was five in dollars fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film making industry of the time for their works during the one nine two seven two eight period the ceremony ran for one five minutes winners had been announced to media three months earlier however that was changed for the second ceremony in one nine three zero since then for the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at one one zero zero pm on the night of the awards this method was used until an occasion when the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the academy has since one nine four one used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners institutions the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history at that time the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films with the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years at the two nine th ceremony held on march two seven one nine five seven the best foreign language film category was introduced until then foreign language films had

in three four three cm tall weighs eight five lb three eight five six kg and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a crusader s sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy actors writers directors producers and technicians the model for the statuette is said to be mexican actor emilio el indio fern ndez sculptor george stanley who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl sculpted cedric gibbons design the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold plated solid bronze within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal a pewter like alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally two four karat gold due to a metal shortage during world war ii oscars were made of painted plaster for three years following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold plated metal ones the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base the original oscar mold was cast in one nine two eight at the c w shumway uncle oscar a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce columnist sidney skolsky was

dubbed the oscar in one nine three nine by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences engraving to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates until two zero one zero winners were expected to return the statuettes to the academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied since two zero one zero winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription processing station at the governor s ball a party

picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders for example a producer of the two zero zero nine best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen

may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast the oscars were first televised in one nine five three by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until one nine six zero when abc took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in one nine six six through one nine seven zero after which nbc resumed the broadcasts abc once again took over broadcast duties in one nine seven six and has broadcast the oscars ever since its current contract with the academy runs through two zero two zero the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the americas in more desirable local timeslots the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite in one nine seven zero but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in five zero countries a decade later the rights were already being sold to six zero countries and by one nine eight four the tv rights to the awards were licensed in seven six countries the ceremonies were moved up from late march or early april to late february or early march starting in two zero zero four to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success of the ncaa men s division i basketball championship which would cut into the academy awards audience the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period some years the ceremony is moved into early march in deference to the winter olympics another reason for the move to late february and early march is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast the awards show holds the distinction of having won the most emmys in history with four seven wins and one nine five nominations after many years of being held on mondays at nine zero zero pm eastern six zero zero p m pacific in one nine nine nine the ceremonies were moved to sundays at eight three zero pm eastern five three zero pm pacific the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier for many years the film industry had opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office the academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industry s long awards season however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail also a january or early february ceremony held on a sunday would have to compete with national football league playoff games such as the super bowl originally scheduled for april eight one nine six eight the four zero th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr on march three zero one nine eight one the five three rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington d c in one nine nine three an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding one two months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject s cultural impact the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours the first oscars in one nine two nine lasted one five minutes at the other end of the spectrum the two zero zero zero ceremony lasted four hours and four minutes in two zero one zero the organizers of the academy awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past four five seconds this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion in two zero one six in a further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an on screen ticker although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the academy awards have steadily dropped the eight eight th academy awards were the lowest rated in the past eight years although with increases in male and one eight four nine viewership while the show itself also faced mixed reception following the show variety reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting tv ratings historically the oscarcast has pulled in a bigger haul when box office hits are favored to win the best picture trophy more than five seven two five million viewers tuned to the telecast for the seven zero th academy awards in one nine nine eight the year of titanic which generated close to us six zero

awards best picture midnight cowboy which drew a four three four household rating on seven april one nine seven zero by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings the seven eight th academy awards which awarded low budgeted independent film crash with a pre oscar gross of us five three four million generated an audience of three eight six four million with a household rating of two two nine one in two zero zero eight the eight zero th academy awards telecast was watched by three one seven six million viewers on average

ceremony was another independently financed film no country for old men venues upright pantages theatre two zero zero eight in one nine two nine the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel from one nine three zero to one nine four three the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles grauman s chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from one nine four four to one nine four six followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from one nine four seven to one nine four eight the two one st academy awards in one nine four nine were held at the academy award theatre at what was the academy s headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood from one nine five zero to one nine six zero the awards were presented at hollywood s pantages theatre with the advent of television the awards from one nine five three to one nine five seven took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the nbc international theatre one nine five three and then at the nbc century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california in one nine six one by one nine six nine the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to los angeles this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center in two zero zero two the kodak theatre now known as the dolby theatre became the current venue of the presentation awards of merit

prestige of the academy awards studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than quality william friedkin an academy award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in two zero zero nine describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself tim dirks editor of amc s filmsite org has written of the academy awards accusations of bias typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the u s the last three months of the calendar year the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded this has led to the coining of the term oscar bait describing such movies this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience e g by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues the eight eight th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott based on critics perception that its all white acting nominee list reflected bias in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by the year two zero two zero symbolism or sentimentalization acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons personal popularity atonement for past mistakes or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominee s entire body of work refusing the award some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars the first to do so was dudley nichols best writing in one nine three five for the informer nichols boycotted the eight th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild george c scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in one nine seven zero for patton at the four three rd academy awards ceremony scott

proper time on earth s geoid it is the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth s surface and for terrestrial time which is used for astronomical calculations when the last leap second was added tai is exactly three six seconds ahead of utc the three six seconds results from the initial difference of one zero seconds at the start of one nine seven two plus two six leap seconds in utc since one nine seven two time coordinates on the tai scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth specifically both julian dates and the gregorian calendar are used tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of one nine five eight and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth operation tai as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over four zero zero atomic clocks in over five zero national laboratories worldwide the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone see signal averaging for a discussion the majority of the clocks are caesium clocks the definition of the si second is written in terms of caesium the participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by a well known integer number of seconds these time scales are denoted in the form utc npl in the utc form where npl in this case identifies the national physical laboratory uk the tai form may be denoted tai npl the latter is not to be confused with ta npl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible this combined time scale is published monthly in ftp ftp two bipm fr pub tai publication cirt circular t and is the canonical tai this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc k equivalent to tai tai k for each participating institution k the same circular also gives tables of tai ta k for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t aside from this once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale doing so does not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time tt history early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in one nine five five using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl the greenwich atomic ga scale began in one nine five five at the royal greenwich observatory the international time bureau bih began a time scale tm or am in july one nine five five using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals the united states naval observatory began the a one scale one three september one nine five six using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs a scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado both the bih scale and a one were defined by an epoch at the beginning of one nine five eight it was set to read julian date two four three six two zero four five one january one nine five eight zero zero zero zero zero zero at the corresponding ut two instant the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed a three in one nine six three and ta bih in one nine six nine this synchronisation was inevitably imperfect depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of ut two at the time ut two as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in one nine six seven and in one nine seven one the name international atomic time tai was assigned to a time scale based on si seconds with no leap seconds during this time irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected in one nine six seven it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates but this was disproven in one nine six eight in the one nine seven zero s it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks starting from julian date two four four three one four four five one january one nine seven seven zero zero zero zero zero zero corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid because the clocks had been on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed down by about one part in a trillion the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system all three of these time scales were defined to read jd two four four three one four four five zero zero three seven two five one january one nine seven seven zero zero zero zero three two one eight four exactly at that instant the offset is to provide continuity with the older ephemeris time tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tt tai tai three two one eight four s the continued existence of tai was questioned in a two zero zero seven letter from the bipm to the itu r which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc utc is a discontinuous i e regularly adjusted by leap seconds time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time from its beginning in one nine six one through december of one nine seven one the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut two afterwards these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut one this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale the post one nine seven one more linear transformation of the bih s atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally the fact that it continues to approximate ut one means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time

considered an altruistic action altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness the word was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves e g pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another third party individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits the actor also may not be expecting a reward the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of one s self the notion of altruism the concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought the term was originally coined in the one nine th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them scientific viewpoints anthropology marcel mauss s book the gift contains a passage note on alms this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice in it he writes alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other generosity is an obligation because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it this is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children compare altruism ethics perception of altruism as self sacrifice compare explanation of alms in various scriptures evolutionary explanations giving alms to beggar children in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies some of the proposed mechanisms are kin selection that animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior one kinship cue is facial resemblance one study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helping behavior another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study this effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families vested interests people are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness extreme self sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup reciprocal altruism see also reciprocity evolution direct reciprocity research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help the effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return one consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future people tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower they tend to help less if they see non cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a community game instead of a wall street game a tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them this has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation the tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped on the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating people sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts as such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non cooperation people are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first this may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises they are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individual s performance relative to a small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group indirect reciprocity the avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person s reputation to become very important a person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously strong reciprocity a form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism a number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence pseudo reciprocity an organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist costly signaling and the handicap principle since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an honest signal of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources this may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner it may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling it is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one s resources heroic risk taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability volunteers assist hurricane victims at the houston astrodome following hurricane katrina both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions one is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else this have been documented in many studies the effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic people who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners when looking for a long term partner altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children it has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman while both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man men may even avoid altruistic women in short term relationships which may be because they expect less success people may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism on the other hand in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous this may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic the reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present while humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs benefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards this may be because such extrinsic top down incentives may replace partially or in whole intrinsic and reputational incentives motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards which overall may make the behaviors less desirable another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them this may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are non cooperators a counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all group selection it has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as david sloan wilson that natural selection can act at the level of non kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members see also in group favoritism group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists helping the homeless in new york city such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment this need not imply that on average five zero or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r price s development of the price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his one nine zero two book mutual aid a factor of evolution and peter singer in his book a darwinian left initial evolutionary problematics there are problems of early stage evolution of altruism a first emotionally empathic individual would if it was genetic have been effectively exploited to death by the preexisting non empathic individuals this applies regardless how far back in evolution the problem is moved not restricted to hominid but extending to pre reptilian or anything in between including early mammals the first empathic individual would effectively be exploited every time another individual was in the right place at the right time to take advantage so no evolutionary adaptation to exploiting empathic individuals would be required for the lethality to take effect it is de facto impossible that mutations for emotional empathy ability to recognize it in others and a direction of it towards those individuals would all occur at the same time an ability to recognize a non existent behavior is of no evolutionary use and so cannot have pre evolved neurobiology jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs d or hospital network j m provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging in their research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october two zero zero six they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard wired and pleasurable psychology the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing another s welfare psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase one s own welfare there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism some definitions specify a self sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory he identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless the empathy altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another s suffering helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues peace corps trainees swearing in as volunteers in cambodia four april two zero zero seven in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person s distress research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders a feeling of personal responsibility or moral norm has also strongly been associated with other pro social behaviors such as charitable giving many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well being in a study of older adults those who volunteered were significantly higher on life satisfaction and will to live and significantly lower in depression anxiety and somatization volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a three zero year period and found that five two of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only three six of those who did volunteer experienced one a study on adults ages five five found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a six three lower likelihood of dying after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a four four reduction in mortality merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness it is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states studies have also been careful to note that feeling over taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others studies suggest that gratitude goes hand in hand with kindness and is also very important for our well being a study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well being psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others doing good and subsequently feeling good as the helper s high sociology sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society altruism morality and social solidarity american sociological association american sociological association altruism morality and social solidarity the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable altruism morality and social solidarity asa this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society pathological altruism pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or well intentioned actions cause more harm than good the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one s own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid religious viewpoints most if not all of the world s religions promote altruism as a very important moral value buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality one challenge facing religious followers is whether altruism should cross the boundary between religious groups or if altruistic expression to other faiths is selective which in itself is contrary to the concept of selflessness buddhism monks collecting alms altruism figures prominently in buddhism love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama speech by the dalai lamathe phrase core of our being is freudian see since all beings includes the individual love and compassion in buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other it is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering in practical terms however since most of us are spontaneously self centered buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others and thus can be characterized as altruistic many would agree with the dalai lama that buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others still the notion of altruism is modified in such a world view since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes dalai lama in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what i cause if i cause suffering then as a natural consequence i will experience suffering if i cause happiness then as a natural consequence i will experience happiness in buddhism karma p li kamma is strictly distinguished from vip ka meaning fruit or result karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause p li hetu in the chain of cause and effect where it comprises the elements of volitional activities pali sankhara and action pali bhava any action is understood to create seeds in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results p li vipaka when they meet the right conditions most types of karmas with good or bad results will keep one in the wheel of sams ra others will liberate one to nirv na buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action motivation usually makes the difference between good and bad but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance so a well intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be bad in that it creates unpleasant results for the actor in buddhism karma is not the only cause of all that happens as taught in the early texts the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories known as niyama dhammas kamma niyama consequences of one s actions utu niyama seasonal changes and climate biija niyama laws of heredity citta niyama will of mind dhamma niyama nature s tendency to produce a perfect type jainism sculpture depicting the jain concept of ahimsa non injury the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings jainism preaches the view of ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings i e uncompromising reverence for all life it also considers all living things to be equal the first tirthankara rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things jainism prescribes a path of non violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors one s unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by straight forwardness and greed by contentment jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks they are non violence ahimsa truthfulness satya non stealing asteya celibacy brahmacharya non possession or non materialism aparigraha the great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders the house holders are encouraged to practice the above mentioned five vows the monks have to observe them very strictly with consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress the principle of non violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha god in jainism because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in one s actions jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders christianity statue of mother teresa in india altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain from biblical to medieval christian traditions tensions between self affirmation and other regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the pauline phrase love seeks not its own interests in his book indoctrination and self deception roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self affirmation and altruism by analysis of other regard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each person s experience and practice from within as in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection st thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part however he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god one john four states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one s fellowman is the same as hatred of god thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love an altruistic action is not always a loving action oord defines altruism as acting for the other s good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one s own good when the other s demands undermine overall well being german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of one s own life and existence another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people s business at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse islam in islam the concept th r altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself for sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one s own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by allah on the human body considered to be property of allah alone the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing th r as abiding by the highest degree of nobility this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in i thar attention is focused on everything in existence a constant concern for allah i e god results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world this concept was emphasized by sufis of islam like rabia al adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to allah i e god and dedication to people thirteenth century turkish sufi poet yunus emre explained this philosophy as yarat lan severiz yaratandan t r or we love the creature because of the creator for many muslims i thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific islamic holidays however i thar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times judaism judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity this is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity sikhism altruism is essential to the sikh religion the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness the fifth nanak guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold two two carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth the ninth guru guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh ji the tenth guru in sikhism was in war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji and complained of his action that they considered counter productive to their struggle on the battlefield what were you doing and why asked the guru i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same hinduism swami sivananda an advaita scholar reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras a vedantic text in his commentary on chapter three of the brahma sutras sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short lived and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one s merit furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit since apurva is non sentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment philosophy there exists a wide range of philosophical views on man s obligations or motivations to act altruistically proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co inhabitants a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one s self interest without specifying

initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism and instead supported laissez faire capitalism which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights in art rand promoted romantic realism she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for aristotle and some aristotelians and classical liberals literary critics received rand s fiction with mixed reviews and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy though academic interest has increased in recent decades the objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas both to the public and in academic settings she has been a significant influence among libertarians and american conservatives life early life rand was born alisa zinov yevna rosenbaum on february two one nine zero five to a russian jewish bourgeois family living in saint petersburg she was the eldest of the three daughters of zinovy zakharovich rosenbaum and his wife anna borisovna n e kaplan largely non observant jews zinovy rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located with a passion for the liberal arts rand later said she found school unchallenging and she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten at the prestigious stoiunina gymnasium her closest friend was vladimir nabokov s younger sister olga the two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the nabokov mansion while nabokova defended constitutional monarchy rand supported republican ideals she was twelve at the time of the february revolution of one nine one seven during which she favored alexander kerensky over tsar nicholas ii the subsequent october revolution and the rule of the bolsheviks under vladimir lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed her father s business was confiscated and the family displaced they fled to the crimean peninsula which was initially under control of the white army during the russian civil war she later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue after graduating from high school in the crimea at one six rand returned with her family to petrograd as saint petersburg was renamed at that time where they faced desperate conditions on occasion nearly starving alt the twelve collegia of what was then petrograd state university rand completed a three year program at petrograd state university after the russian revolution universities were opened to women allowing rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at petrograd state university where at the age of one six she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history at the university she was introduced to the writings of aristotle and plato who would be her greatest influence and counter influence respectively a third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was friedrich nietzsche able to read french german and russian rand also discovered the writers fyodor dostoevsky victor hugo edmond rostand and friedrich schiller who became her perennial favorites along with many other bourgeois students rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating however after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate which rand did in october one nine two four she subsequently studied for a year at the state technicum for screen arts in leningrad for one of her assignments she wrote an essay about the polish actress pola negri which became her first published work by this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be rand possibly as a cyrillic contraction of her birth surname and she adopted the first name ayn either from a finnish name aino or

autumn of one nine two five rand was granted a visa to visit american relatives she departed on january one seven one nine two six when she arrived in new york city on february one nine one nine two six she was so impressed with the skyline of manhattan that she cried what she later called tears of splendor intent on staying in the united states to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with relatives in chicago one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free she then set out for hollywood california initially rand struggled in hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses a chance meeting with famed director cecil b demille led to a job as an extra in his film the king of kings as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter while working on the king of kings she met an aspiring young actor frank o connor the two were married on april one five one nine two nine she became a permanent us resident in july one

costume department at rko studios she made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the united states but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate early fiction rand s first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay red pawn to universal studios in one nine three two although it was never produced this was followed by the courtroom drama night of january one

and one of the two different endings depending on the jury s verdict would then be performed in one nine four one paramount pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result ideal is a novel and play written in one nine three four which were first published in two zero one five by her estate the heroine is an actress who embodies randian ideals rand s first published novel the semi autobiographical we the living was published in one nine three six set in soviet russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state in a one nine five nine foreword to the novel rand stated that we the living is as near to an autobiography as i will ever write it is not an autobiography in the literal but only in the intellectual sense the plot is invented the background is not initial sales were slow and the american publisher let it go out of print although european editions continued to sell after the success of her later novels rand was able to release a revised version in one nine five nine that has since sold over three million copies in one nine four two without rand s knowledge or permission the novel was made into a pair of italian films noi vivi and addio kira rediscovered in the one nine six zero s these films were re edited into a new version which was approved by rand and re released as we the living in one nine eight six her novella anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel the fountainhead it presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word i has been forgotten and replaced with we it was published in england in one nine three eight but rand initially could not find an american publisher as with we the living rand s later success allowed her to get a revised version published in one nine four six which has sold more than three five million copies the fountainhead and political activism during the one nine four zero s rand became politically active both she and her husband worked full time in volunteer positions for the one nine four zero presidential campaign of republican wendell willkie this work led to rand s first public speaking experiences including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from new york city audiences who had just viewed pro willkie newsreels an experience she greatly enjoyed this activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free market capitalism she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt and his wife and hazlitt introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises despite her philosophical differences with them rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and both of them expressed admiration for her once mises referred to rand as the most courageous man in america a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer isabel paterson rand questioned the well informed paterson about american history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book the god of the machine rand s first major success as a writer came with the fountainhead in one nine four three a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years the novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as second handers those who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves it was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the bobbs merrill company on the insistence of editor archibald ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it while completing the novel rand was prescribed benzedrine a brand of amphetamine to fight fatigue the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel but when the book was done she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings the fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success bringing rand fame and financial security in one nine four three rand sold the rights for a film version to warner bros and she returned to hollywood to write the screenplay finishing her work on that screenplay she was hired by producer hal wallis as a screenwriter and script doctor her work for wallis included the screenplays for the oscar nominated love letters and you came along this role gave rand time to work on other projects including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called the moral basis of individualism although the planned book was never completed a condensed version was published as an essay titled the only path to tomorrow in the january one nine four four edition of reader s digest magazine rand extended her involvement with free market and anti communist activism while working in hollywood she became involved with the motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals a hollywood anti communist group and wrote articles on the group s behalf she also joined the anti communist american writers association a visit by isabel paterson to meet with rand s california associates led to a final falling out between the two when paterson made comments to valued political allies which rand considered rude in one nine four seven during the second red scare rand testified as a friendly witness before the united states house un american activities committee her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the soviet union and the portrayal of it in the one nine four four film song of russia rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was she wanted to also criticize the lauded one nine four six film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but she was not allowed to testify about it when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations rand described the process as futile after several delays the film version of the fountainhead was released in one nine four nine although it used rand s screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end complaining about its editing acting and other elements atlas shrugged and objectivism rand s novella anthem was reprinted in the june one nine five three issue of the pulp magazine famous fantastic mysteries in the years following the publication of the fountainhead rand received numerous letters from readers some of whom the book profoundly influenced in one nine five one rand moved from los angeles to new york city where she gathered a group of these admirers around her this group jokingly designated the collective included future federal reserve chairman alan greenspan a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal later nathaniel branden and his wife barbara and barbara s cousin leonard peikoff at first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel atlas shrugged as the manuscript pages were written in one nine five four rand s close relationship with the younger nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair with the consent of their spouses atlas shrugged published in one nine five seven was considered rand s magnum opus rand described the theme of the novel as the role of the mind in man s existence and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational self interest it advocates the core tenets of rand s philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy the novel s hero and leader of the strike john galt describes the strike as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation s wealth and achievement with this fictional strike rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart the novel includes elements of romance mystery and science fiction and it contains rand s most extensive statement of objectivism in any of her works of fiction a lengthy monologue delivered by galt despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller in an interview with mike wallace rand declared herself the most creative thinker alive after completing the novel rand fell into a severe depression atlas shrugged was rand s last completed work of fiction a turning point in her life it marked the end of rand s career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher in one nine five eight nathaniel branden established nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute nbi to promote rand s philosophy collective members gave lectures for nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that she edited rand later published some of these articles in book form critics including some former nbi students and branden himself have described the culture of nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand with some describing nbi or the objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers rand was unimpressed with many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her however some former nbi students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated with the problem being concentrated among rand s closest followers in new york later years throughout the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale princeton columbia harvard and mit she received an honorary doctorate from lewis bums supporting israel in the yom kippur war of one nine seven three against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting savages saying european colonists had the right to develop land taken from american indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it she also endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in one nine six four whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for the objectivist newsletter grave marker for rand and her husband at kensico cemetery in valhalla new york alt a twin gravestone bearing the name frank o connor on the left and ayn rand o connor on the right in one nine six four nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand when she learned of it in one nine six eight though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended rand terminated her relationship with both brandens which led to the closure of nbi rand published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life branden later apologized in an interview to every student of objectivism for perpetuating the ayn rand mystique and for contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the objectivist movement in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in one nine seven four after decades of heavy smoking in one nine seven six she retired from writing her newsletter and despite her initial objections allowed evva pryor a social worker from her attorney s office to enroll her in social security and medicare during the late one nine seven zero s her activities within the objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on november nine one nine seven nine one of her final projects was work on a never completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged rand died of heart failure on march six one nine eight two at her home in new york city and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york rand s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket in her will rand named leonard peikoff the heir to her estate philosophy rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man s senses she rejected all claims of non perceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing rand argued that the requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria of conceptualization which she summarized in the form of a philosophical razor known as rand s razor it states that concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessity the corollary of which is nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic synthetic dichotomy in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational self interest as the guiding moral principle she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself she referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of man s survival qua man she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites rand s political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights she opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics she denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism she rejected anarchism as a na ve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice rand s aesthetics defined art as a selective re creation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgments according to rand art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will she described her own approach to literature as romantic realism rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three a s aristotle aquinas and ayn rand in a one nine five nine interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me i devised the rest of my philosophy myself however she also found early inspiration in friedrich nietzsche and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rand s journals in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later revised and in her overall writing style however by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsche s ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed among the philosophers rand held in particular disdain was immanuel kant whom she referred to as a monster although philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts her ethics and her discovery in politics that evil the violation of rights consists of the initiation of force she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows reception and legacy reviews during rand s lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation rand s first novel we the living was admired by the literary critic h l mencken her broadway play night of january one six th was both a critical and popular success and the fountainhead was hailed by a reviewer in the new york times as masterful rand s novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic however they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth the first reviews rand received were for night of january one six th reviews of the production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer rand believed that her first novel we the living was not widely reviewed but rand scholar michael s berliner says it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately one two five different reviews being published in more than two zero zero publications overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work her one nine three eight novella anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues rand s first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed there was a positive review in the new york times that rand greatly appreciated the reviewer called rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper rationing other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rand s style offensively pedestrian rand s one nine five seven novel atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative in the national review conservative author whittaker chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly he described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to a gas chamber go atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put downs calling it execrable claptrap and a nightmare they said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity author flannery o connor wrote in a letter to a friend that the fiction of ayn rand is as low as you can get re fiction i hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail rand s nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers on the one zero zero th anniversary of rand s birth in two zero zero five edward rothstein writing for the new york times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neo romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society in two zero zero seven book critic leslie clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of pseudo philosophy in two zero zero nine gq s critic columnist tom carson described her books as capitalism s version of middlebrow religious novels such as ben hur and the left behind series popular interest alt an engraving in all capital letters that reads throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision ayn rand a quote

s books continue to be widely sold and read with over two nine million copies sold as of two zero one three with about one zero of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the ayn rand institute in one nine nine eight modern library readers voted atlas shrugged the two zero th century s finest work of fiction followed by the fountainhead in second place anthem in seventh and we the living eighth none of the four appeared on the critics list although rand s influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her work rand s work continues to be among the top sellers among books in india rand s contemporary admirers included fellow novelists such as ira levin kay nolte smith and l neil smith and later writers such as erika holzer and terry goodkind have been influenced by her other artists who have cited rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist steve ditko and musician neil peart of rush rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work john allison of bb rand s is a tortured immortality one in which she s as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist and that jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture two movies have been made about rand s life a one nine nine seven documentary film ayn rand a sense of life was nominated for the academy award for documentary feature the passion of ayn rand a one nine nine nine television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards rand s image also appears on a one nine nine nine u s postage stamp designed by artist nick gaetano political influence although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism jim powell a senior fellow at the cato institute considers rand one of the three most important women along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson of modern american libertarianism and david nolan one of the founders of the libertarian party stated that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist in his history of the libertarian movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large and biographer jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right a protester at an april two zero zero nine tea party rally carries a sign referring to john galt the hero of rand s novel atlas shrugged alt in a large outdoor crowd a man holds up a poster with the words i am john galt in all capital letters she faced intense opposition from william f buckley jr and other contributors for the national review magazine they published numerous criticisms in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s by whittaker chambers garry wills and m stanton evans nevertheless her influence among conservatives forced buckley and other national review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the united states republican party despite rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives such as being pro choice and an atheist a one nine eight seven article in the new york times referred to her as the reagan administration s novelist laureate republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels the late two zero zero zero s financial crisis spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis and opinion articles compared real world events with the plot of the novel during this time signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests there was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan for example mother jones remarked that rand s particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy the talented and the powerful as the oppressed while equating randian individual well being with that of the volk according to goebbels corey robin of the nation alleged similarities between the moral syntax of randianism and fascism academic reaction during rand s lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars when the first academic book about rand s philosophy appeared in one nine seven one its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously a few articles about rand s ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in one nine eight two many of them in the personalist one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who argued that her meta ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is ought problem posed by david hume some responses to nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in the personalist arguing that nozick misstated rand s case academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rand s novels when she began researching her in one nine seven three and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the one nine seven zero s since rand s death interest in her work has gradually increased historian jennifer burns has identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand the most recent of which is an explosion of scholarship since the year two zero zero zero however few universities currently include rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study gladstein chris matthew sciabarra allan gotthelf edwin a locke and tara smith have taught her work in academic institutions sciabarra co edits the journal of ayn rand studies a nonpartisan peer reviewed journal dedicated to the study of rand s philosophical and literary work in one nine eight seven gotthelf helped found the ayn rand society with george walsh and david kelley and has been active in sponsoring seminars about rand and her ideas smith has written several academic books and papers on rand s ideas including ayn rand s normative ethics the virtuous egoist a volume on rand s ethical theory published by cambridge university press rand s ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson and duke universities scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the one nine nine zero s rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas b rasmussen while stressing the importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional philosopher jack wheeler says that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rand s ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in two zero zero one john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation in a one nine nine nine interview in the chronicle of higher education sciabarra commented i know they laugh at rand while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community libertarian philosopher michael huemer has argued that very few people find rand s ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence he attributes the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist thus atlas shrugged outsells not only the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as ludwig von mises friedrich hayek or frederic bastiat but also rand s own non fiction works political scientist charles murray while praising rand s literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher robert h bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas objectivist movement in one nine eight five rand s heir leonard peikoff established the ayn rand institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rand s ideas and works in one nine nine zero philosopher david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the atlas society in two zero zero

colonial empire berbers are generally considered to be the indigenous inhabitants of algeria following the arab conquest of north africa most indigenous inhabitants were arabised thus although most algerians are berber in origin most identify with arab identity en masse algerians are a mix of berbers with some additional elements such as arabs turks and andalusians people from southern spain who migrated after the reconquista algeria is a regional and middle power the north african country supplies large amounts of natural gas to europe and energy exports are the backbone of the economy

anchorages as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others numidia along with egypt rome and carthage two zero zero bce by the early four th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the

declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars in one four six bc the city of carthage was destroyed as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the

of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern day morocco to the atlantic ocean the high point of berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of massinissa in the two nd century bc after masinissa s death in one four eight bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times massinissa s line survived until two four ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire uprightnail berber king masinissa for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products saint augustine

coastal numidia they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the byzantines arrived lepcis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival upright jugurtha middle ages mansourah mosque tlemcen fatimid caliphate at its greatest extent after negligible resistance from the locals the arabs conquered algeria in the mid seven th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the new faith after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the aghlabids almohads abdalwadid zirids rustamids hammadids almoravids and the fatimids during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to suggest the afroasiatic language family the great sufi masters sidi boumediene abu madyan and sidi el houari as well as the emirs abd al mu min and y ghm rasen it was during this time period that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy primarily made of arabs and levantians extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them the resultant war is recounted in the epic t ghrib t in al t ghr b t the amazigh zirid hero kh l f al z nat asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero bu zayd al hilal and many other arab knights in a string of victories the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes the two main branches were the botr and barn s tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houaras zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata all these tribes made independent territorial decisions several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands ibn khaldun

family zirid somehow recognizing the suzerainty of the fatimid caliph of cairo probably in one zero four eight the zirid ruler or viceroy el mu izz decided to end this suzerainty the fatimid state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition the viceroy el mu izz also found another means of revenge between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence both banu hilal and banu sulaym among others whose presence disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot the then fatimid vizier devised to relinquish control of the maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign this not only prompted the bedouins to leave but the fatimidtreasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance whole tribes set off with women children ancestors animals and camping equipment some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but each meeting the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and arabs remained masters of the field the flood was still rising and in one zero five seven the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they gradually choked qalaa of banu hammad as they had done kairouan

subsequently with the institution of a regular ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three year terms the pasha was assisted by janissaries known in algeria as the ojaq

their conversations is given in the novel later in the novel the reader discovers this worker s true identity before working for taggart transcontinental galt worked as an engineer for the twentieth century motor company where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity but abandoned his prototype and his employment when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment this prototype was found by dagny taggart and hank rearden galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel in a valley concealed by himself where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership much of the book s third division is given to his broadcast speech which presents the author s philosophy of objectivism

stronger than steel with similar properties to stainless steel he lives in philadelphia with his wife lillian his brother philip and his elderly mother rearden represents a type of self made man or prototypical hero and illustrates rand s theory of sex in so far as he accepts the traditional view of sexual congress as a subhuman instinct but responds sexually to dagny taggart eddie willers edwin eddie willers is the special assistant to the vice president in charge of operations at taggart transcontinental his father and grandfather worked for the taggarts and himself likewise he is completely loyal to dagny and to taggart transcontinental willers does not possess the creative ability of galt s associates but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations after dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive galt willers maintains the railroad until its collapse ragnar danneskj ld one of galt s first followers and world famous as a pirate who seizes relief ships sent from the united states to the people s states of europe he works to ensure that once those espousing galt s philosophy are restored to their

operational decisions on his own he relies on his sister dagny taggart to actually run the railroad but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti capitalist moral and political beliefs in a sense he is the antithesis of dagny this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends and the horror that he will succeed at this in the final chapters of the novel he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect lillian rearden the unsupportive wife of hank rearden who dislikes his habits and secretly at first seeks to ruin rearden to prove her own value lillian achieves this when she passes information to james taggart about her husband s

act for the good wesley mouch the incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading

of the past and present social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans archaeology which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the united states while in europe it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines such as history origin and development of the term the abstract noun is first attested in reference to history its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann their new latin derived from the combining forms of the greek words nthr pos human and l gos study its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle it began to be used in english possibly via french by the early one eight th century through the one nine th century in one six four seven the bartholins founders of the university of copenhagen defined as follows anthropology that is to say the science that treats of man is divided ordinarily and with reason into anatomy which considers the body and the parts and psychology which speaks of the soul sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by tienne serres in one eight three eight to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in one eight five zero at the national museum of natural history france by jean louis armand de quatrefages de br au various short lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed the soci t ethnologique de paris the first to use ethnology was formed in one eight three nine its members were primarily anti slavery activists when slavery was abolished in france in one eight four eight the soci t was abandoned meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in one eight four two as well as the ethnological society of london in one eight four three a break away group of the aborigines protection society these anthropologists of the times were liberal anti slavery and pro human rights activists they maintained international connections anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier one nine th century theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy linguistics and ethnology making feature by feature comparisons of their subject matters were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then for them the publication of charles darwin s on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late one eight five zero s there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the soci t de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the soci t d anthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in one eight five nine when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism his definition now became the study of the human group considered as a whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature broca being what today would be called a neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called broca s area after him his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but a german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six volume work entitled die anthropologie der naturv lker one eight five nine one eight six four the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples the last two volumes were published posthumously waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man by nature he meant matter animated by the divine breath i e he was an animist following broca s lead waitz points out that anthropology is a new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is a unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men waitz was influential among the british ethnologists in one eight six three the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology it was the two nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence representatives from the french soci t were present though not broca in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as a standard among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor a geologist previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist similar organizations in other countries followed the american anthropological association in one nine zero two the anthropological society of madrid one eight six five the anthropological society of vienna one eight seven zero the italian society of anthropology and ethnology one eight seven one and many others subsequently the majority of these were evolutionist one notable exception was the one eight six nine founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists not religious himself he insisted that darwin s conclusions lacked empirical foundation during the last three decades of the one nine th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association the major theorists belonged to these organizations they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning by one eight nine eight the american association for the advancement of science was able to report that four eight educational institutions in one three countries had some curriculum in anthropology none of the seven five faculty members were under a department named anthropology two zero th and two one st centuries this meagre statistic expanded in the two zero th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world s higher educational institutions many thousands in number anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene organization has reached global level for example the world council of anthropological associations wcaa a network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations since the work of franz boas and bronis aw malinowski in the late one nine th and early two zero th centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on cross cultural comparisons long term in depth examination of context and the importance it places on participant observation or experiential immersion in the area of research cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas arguments against one nine th century racial ideology through margaret mead s advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of post colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early two zero th century biological or physical anthropology social cultural or sociocultural anthropology and archaeology plus anthropological linguistics these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology a term coined and defined by adam f koll r in one seven eight three in non colonial european countries social anthropology is now defined as the study of social organization in non state societies it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition fields anthropology is a global discipline where humanities social and natural sciences are forced to confront one another anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late two zero th century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies according to clifford geertz sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies during the one nine seven zero s and one nine nine zero s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist due to this difference in epistemology the four sub fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades sociocultural sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts how one s culture affects experience for self and group contributing to more complete understanding of the people s knowledge customs and institutions while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history in that it helps develop understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations such as minorities subgroups dissidents etc there is no hard and fast distinction between them and these categories overlap to a considerable degree inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross cultural comparison this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research i e an ethnographic monograph as methodology ethnography is based upon long term fieldwork within a community or other research site participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures the process of participant observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic conceptual vs etic or technical point of view the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology including the industrialized and de industrialized west cultures in the standard cross cultural sample sccs of world societies are biological forensic anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains such as these found lying in scrub in western australia c one nine zero zero one nine one zero biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non human primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation archaeological excavations at the three eight zero zero year old edgewater park site iowa archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways linguistic linguistic anthropology also called anthropological linguistics seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and non verbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis key topics by field sociocultural art media music dance and film art one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most non western contexts to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities boas primitive art claude l vi strauss the way of the masks one nine eight two or geertz s art as cultural system one nine eight three are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics media upright a punu tribe mask gabon central africa media anthropology also known as anthropology of media or mass media emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production e g ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early one nine nine zero s music ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire visual visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid one nine nine zero s new media while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphics paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology economic political economic applied and development economic economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical its origins as a sub field of anthropology begin with the polish british founder of anthropology bronislaw malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of gift giving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective political economy political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to non capitalist societies political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture three main areas of interest rapidly developed the first of these areas was concerned with the pre capitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes sahlins work on hunter gatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world s population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist world system more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and post industrial capitalism around the world applied applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems it is a complex of related research based instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action and or the formulation of policy more simply applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community it is closely related to development anthropology distinct from the more critical anthropology of development development anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short why does so much planned development fail kinship feminism gender and sexuality kinship kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent one s social relations during development and also relatives by marriage feminist feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge anthropology engages often with feminists from non western traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white european and american feminists historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology as a specialization medical nutritional psychological cognitive and transpersonal medical medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole it focuses on the following six basic fields the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care the patient physician relationship the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments the interaction of social environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations critical ethnopsychiatry beneduce two zero zero four two zero zero seven the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non western settings other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering farmer one nine nine nine two zero zero three beneduce two zero one zero as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry nutritional nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people psychological psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural group with its own history language practices and conceptual categories shape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes cognitive cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them transpersonal transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness asc and transpersonal experience however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross cultural issues for instance the roles of myth ritual diet and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences political and legal political political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the one nine six zero s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels first of all anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state regulated sphere as in patron client relations or tribal political organization second of all anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions an anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today geertz comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example legal legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the cross cultural study of social ordering earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings public public anthropology was created by robert borofsky a professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change borofsky two zero zero four nature science and technology cyborg cyborg anthropology originated as a sub focus group within the american anthropological association s annual meeting in one nine nine three the sub group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science donna haraway s one nine eight five cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings digital digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital era technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture the field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases these include techno anthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology ecological ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments the sub field is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems environmental environmental anthropology is a sub specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues and more the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for against or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly organizing participation or indirectly articles documentaries books ethnographies such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park historical ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names religion the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is a cultural product created by the human community that worships it urban urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism ulf hannerz quotes a one nine six zero s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot anti urban by definition various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes there are two principle approaches in urban anthropology by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city key topics by field archaeological and biological anthrozoology anthrozoology also known as human animal studies is the study of interaction between living things it is a burgeoning interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy biocultural biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the two zero th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology evolutionary evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non hominin primates evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present it is based on a scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present forensic forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victim s remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law palaeoanthropology paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology it is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints organizations contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association aaa which was founded in one nine zero three membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe in one nine eight nine a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists easa which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub fields of anthropology sometimes divided up by nation or region and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines such as geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and so on belonging to professional

historians and scientists engaged in field research have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism some commentators have contended that the discipline grew out of colonialism perhaps was in league with it and derived some of its key notions from it consciously or not see for example gough pels and salemink but cf lewis two zero zero four that ethnographic work was often ahistorical writing about people as if they were out of time in an ethnographic present johannes fabian time and its other ethics of cultural relativism as part of their quest for scientific objectivity present day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has an influence on all the sub fields of anthropology this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by another s values or viewpoints but be examined dispassionately on their own terms there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another culture ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism mutilation including circumcision and subincision and torture topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of man s inhumanity to man to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor sub fields ethical stance to military involvement anthropologists involvement with the u s government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists but by the one nine four zero s many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence for example office of strategic services and the office of war information at the same time david h price s work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little although anthropologist hugo nutini was active in the stillborn project camelot many anthropologists students and teachers were active in the antiwar movement numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association aaa professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth asa has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous the aaa s current statement of professional responsibility clearly states that in relation with their own government and with host governments no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us army s strategy in afghanistan the christian science monitor reports that counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system hts program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq in two zero zero nine the american anthropological association s commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding in part that when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions not subject to external review where data collection occurs in the context of war integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency and in a potentially coercive environment all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology in summary while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of anthropology within dod aaa commission releases final report on army human terrain system american anthropological association post world war ii developments before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology basic trends there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using a variety of methods over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia in the one nine nine zero s and two zero zero zero s decade calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals behaviors ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to a community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeology further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences by making comparisons across cultural traditions time based and cultural regions space based anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method a central part of their science commonalities between fields because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises see history of anthropology including but not limited to fossil hunting exploring documentary film making paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time past societies and space non european non western societies for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late one nine six zero s now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author s home it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists but this is increasingly changing starting in the one nine seven zero s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain fieldwork and developing with the center founded by marc aug le centre d anthropologie des mondes contemporains the anthropological research center of contemporary societies since the one nine eight zero s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people increasingly

engineering agricultural biotechnology agricultural biotechnology is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques including genetic engineering molecular markers molecular diagnostics vaccines and tissue culture to modify living organisms plants animals and microorganisms fertilizer one of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue which can take a few months to several years to decompose depending on the crop s c to n ratio and the local environment a local science with the exception of theoretical agronomy research in agronomy more than in any other field is strongly related to local areas it can be considered a science of ecoregions because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate which are never exactly the same from one place to another many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather soil characteristics and specific crops has to be studied locally others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible and the human dimension of interaction with nature history of agricultural science agricultural science began with gregor mendel s genetic work but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in one eight th century germany in the united states a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of one eight eight seven which used the term agricultural science the hatch act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer the smith hughes act of one nine one seven shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built after one nine zero six public expenditures on agricultural research in the us exceeded private expenditures for the next four four years intensification of agriculture since the one nine six zero s in developed and developing countries often referred to as the green revolution was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary products as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste treatment technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non essential economic goods in fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science new technologies such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistical analysis and precision farming balancing these as above are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human nature interactions of traditional agriculture including interaction of religion and agriculture and the non material components of agricultural production systems prominent agricultural scientists norman borlaug father of the green revolution robert bakewell norman borlaug luther burbank george washington

philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout europe egypt and asia it aimed to purify mature and perfect certain objects common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals e g lead into noble ones particularly gold the creation of an elixir of immortality the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease and the development of an alkahest a universal solvent the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and in the hellenistic and western tradition the achievement of gnosis in europe the creation of a philosopher s stone was variously connected with all of these projects in english the term is often limited to descriptions of european alchemy but similar practices existed in the far east the indian subcontinent and the muslim world in europe following the one two th century renaissance produced by the translation of arabic works on science and the recovery of aristotle alchemists played a significant role in early modern science particularly chemistry and medicine islamic and european alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques theory terminology and experimental method some of which are still in use today however they continued antiquity s belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism their work was guided by hermetic principles related to magic mythology and religion modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite the arguments of scholars like homyard and von franz that they should be understood as complementary the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of protochemistry medicine and charlatanism the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts despite this split which von franz believes has existed since the western traditions origin in a mix of greek philosophy that was mixed with egyptian and mesopotamian technology numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as bolus of mendes s three rd century on physical and mystical matters name the word alchemy was borrowed from old french alquemie alkimie taken from medieval latin alchymia and which is in turn borrowed from arabic al k miy philosopher s stone the arabic word is borrowed from late greek ch me a ch m a black magic with the agglutination of the arabic definite article al this ancient greek word was derived from the early greek name for egypt ch mia based on the egyptian name for egypt k me hieroglyphic khmi lit black earth as opposed to red desert sand the medieval latin form was influenced by greek chymeia meaning mixture and referring to pharmaceutical chemistry history alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be largely independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and its zone of cultural influence indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco roman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths whereas western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of but influenced by various western religions it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other hellenistic egypt ambix cucurbit and retort of zosimos from marcelin berthelot collection des anciens alchimistes grecs three vol paris one eight eight seven one eight eight eight the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its pre eminence through most of the greek and roman periods here elements of technology religion mythology and hellenistic philosophy each with their own much longer histories combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the west zosimos of panopolis wrote the oldest known books on alchemy while mary the jewess is credited as being the first non fictitious western alchemist they wrote in greek and lived in egypt under roman rule mythology zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus or thrice great hermes his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes hermes and his caduceus or serpent staff were among alchemy s principal symbols according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the forty two books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge the hermetica of thrice great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era technology the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to three five zero zero many writings were lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria two nine two few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x dating from three zero zero five zero zero they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes or pseudo democritus which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art philosophy alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy s character an important example of alchemy s roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth st augustine later affirmed this in the four th four zero zero greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors by the middle of the seven th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the eight th and nine th centuries india the vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold the use of mercury for alchemy is first documented in the three rd or four th century arthashastra buddhist texts from the two nd to five th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold greek alchemy may have been introduced to ancient india through the invasions of alexander the great in three two five and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the greeks like gandh ra although hard evidence for this is lacking the one one th century persian chemist and physician ab rayh n b r n who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni reported that they the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body sanskrit divya deham and immortality while still embodied sanskrit j van mukti sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god iva and the menstrual blood of the goddess dev some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kaly ak rakam of ugr ditya written in south india in the early nine th century two famous early indian alchemical authors were n g rjuna siddha and nityan tha siddha n g rjuna siddha was a buddhist monk his book rasendramangalam is an example of indian alchemy and medicine nityan tha siddha wrote rasaratn kara also a highly influential work in sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and n g rjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold reliable scholarship on indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white trustworthy scholarship on indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account an important modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has also been provided by david gordon white at oxford bibliographies online the contents of three nine sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in g jan meulenbeld s history of indian medical literature the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating chapter one three of himl various works on rasa stra and ratna stra or various works on alchemy and gems gives brief details of a further six five five six hundred and fifty five treatises in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet two zero one four been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy muslim world jabir ibn hayyan geber considered the father of chemistry introduced a scientific and experimental approach to alchemy after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word al k miy the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy platonic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late seven th and early eight th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship in the late eight th century j bir ibn hayy n latinized as geber or geberus introduced a new approach to alchemy based on scientific methodology and controlled experimentation in the laboratory in contrast to the ancient greek and egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible with very little concern for laboratory work jabir is thus considered by many to be the father of chemistry albeit others reserve that title for robert boyle or antoine lavoisier the science historian paul kraus wrote jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation early islamic chemists such as jabir ibn hayyan al kindi alkindus and muhammad ibn zakar ya r zi rasis or rhazes contributed a number of key chemical discoveries such as the muriatic hydrochloric acid sulfuric and nitric acids and more the discovery that aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir jabir s ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result by this reasoning the search for the philosopher s stone was introduced to western alchemy jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance s name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element s physical properties the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity the atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir from the nine th to one four th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus ab al rayh n al b r n avicenna and ibn khaldun in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals east asia upright zero five taoist alchemists often use this alternate version of the taijitu whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine the philosopher s stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher s stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists as previously stated above chinese alchemy was more related to medicine it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life described in nine th century texts and used in fireworks in china by the one zero th century it was used in cannons by one two nine zero from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the muslim world and europe gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in one two four one and in europe by the one four th century chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion and to martial arts such as tai chi chuan and kung fu although some tai chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of taoism not alchemical in fact in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources the aforementioned tai chi chuan mastering of the qi etc medieval europe the alchemist in search of the philosopher s stone by joseph wright one seven seven one the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to one one february one one four four with the completion of robert of chester s translation of the arabic book of the composition of alchemy although european craftsmen and technicians preexisted robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in one two th century toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and al razi these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought the one one th century st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context in the early one two th century peter abelard followed anselm s work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west in the early one three th century robert grosseteste used abelard s methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking through much of the one two th and one three th centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists in the one three th century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms albertus magnus a dominican monk is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals from the time shortly after his death through to the one five th century more than two eight alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to albert s student thomas aquinas roger bacon a franciscan monk who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his great work for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy s connections to soteriology and christian theology bacon s writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time the practical however confirmed the theoretical thought experiment and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine in later european legend however bacon became an archmage in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owner s questions soon after bacon the influential work of pseudo geber sometimes identified as paul of taranto appeared his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described by the end of the one three th century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man s soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam by purifying the two parts of man s soul man could be reunited with god in the one four th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves dante piers plowman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars pope john xxii s one three one seven edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo alchemists in one four zero three henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and a number were granted by henry vi and edward iv these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone the one four th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova nicolas flamel is a well known alchemist but a good example of pseudepigraphy the practice of giving your works the name of someone else usually more famous though the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in one six one two flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher s stone his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosopher s stone through the one four th and one five th centuries alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art renaissance and early modern europe page from alchemic treatise of ramon llull one six th century during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed in the late one five th century marsilo ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa one four eight six one five three five who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermetism and alchemy he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim one four nine three one five four one cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of agrippa s occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them paracelsian practical alchemy especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyric a synonym for alchemy from the greek words meaning to separate and to join together based on the latin alchemic maxim solve et coagula iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus john dee one three july one five two seven december one six zero eight followed agrippa s occult tradition though better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth i dee s alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in one five six four was his most popular and influential work his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below during the one seven th century a short lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher s stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels alchemist sendivogius one five six six one six three six by jan matejko one eight six seven entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of renaissance europe alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late one six th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswick l neburg henry v duke of brunswick l neburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hesse kassel all contracted alchemists john s son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus though most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudo alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance betr ger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and small scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic for example tycho brahe one five four six one six zero one an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory research institute michael sendivogius micha s dziw j one five six six one six three six a polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around one six zero zero sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in one six two one applied this in a submarine isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see isaac newton s occult studies than he did to either optics or physics other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont their hermetism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science late modern period robert boyle the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the one seven th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its apogee in the one eight th century as late as one seven eight one james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and anti aristotelian paracelsian and anti paracelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and more plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof robert boyle one six two seven one six nine one pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the one eight th and one nine th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton beginning around one seven two zero a rigid distinction was drawn between alchemy and chemistry for the first time by the one seven four zero s alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the scientific enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to separate and divorce the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the one nine th and two zero th centuries and even to the present day during the occult revival of the early one nine th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science the esoteric or occultist school which arose during the one nine th century held and continues to hold the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes in the one nine th century revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy atwood s work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists one eight five five attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state in one eight four five baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion women in alchemy several women figure in the earliest history of alchemy michael maier names mary the jewess cleopatra the alchemist medera and taphnutia as the four women who knew how to make the philosopher s stone zosimos sister theosebia later known as euthica the arab and isis the prophetess also play a role in the early alchemical texts the first alchemist is recognized as being mary the jewess c two zero zero a d mary is known for a number of improvements on alchemy equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry her most well known advancements are heating and distillation processes the water bath also known as bain marie is said to have been invented by or at least improved by her this double boiler was often used in chemistry for processes that might require gentle heating the tribikos a basic still and the kerotakis a more intricate distilling apparatus are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her while these were great achievements mary the jewess most critical contribution is considered to be the identification of hydrochloric acid a frequently used chemical today though we have no writing from maria herself she is known from the fourth century writings of zosimos of panopolis due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women after the greco roman period women s names appear less frequently the alchemical literature women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods aside from the fictitious account of perenelle flamel mary anne atwood s a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery one eight five zero marks their return during the nineteenth century occult revival modern historical research the history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study as the language of the alchemists is analyzed historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism exeseso the european society for the study of western esotericism esswe and the university of amsterdam s sub department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents a large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam a recipe found in a mid one nine th century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold the author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis published by the history of science society core concepts mandala illustrating common alchemical concepts symbols and processes from spiegel der kunst und natur western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology as such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity similarly the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosopher s stone hermetism in the eyes of a variety of esoteric and hermetic practitioners alchemy is fundamentally spiritual transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection the writings attributed to hermes trismegistus are a primary source of alchemical theory he is named alchemy s founder and chief patron authority inspiration and guide early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis c ad three zero zero highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul this approach continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes were used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas were a blind hiding their true spiritual philosophy practitioners and patrons such as melchior cibinensis and pope innocent viii existed within the ranks of the church while martin luther applauded alchemy for its consistency with christian teachings both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosopher s stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal in texts that are written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning in his one seven six six alchemical catechism th odore henri de tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was a symbol magnum opus the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors nigredo a blackening or melanosis albedo a whitening or leucosis citrinitas a yellowing or xanthosis rubedo a reddening purpling or iosis modern alchemy due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the one eight th century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence m principe and william r newman have interpreted the decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts at the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as george calian and anna marie roos who question the reading of principe and newman interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the self transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought traditional medicine traditional medicine sometimes involves the transmutation of natural substances using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques in ayurveda the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity these processes are actively used to the present day spagyrists of the two zero th century albert richard riedel and jean dubuis merged paracelsian alchemy with occultism teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods the schools they founded les philosophes de la nature and the paracelsus research society popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products the courses books organizations and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice psychology alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images after being given a copy of the translation of the secret of the golden flower a chinese alchemical text by his friend richard wilhelm jung discovered a direct correlation between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the internal or psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients he called the creation of the gold or lapis within the process of individuation together with his alchemical mystica soror jungian swiss analyst marie louise von franz jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available and pored over them the volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy s popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage his writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding of the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces archetypes that influence all of life both von franz and jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is volume one four of his collected works mysterium conuinctionis literature alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to j k rowling here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus in the one four th century chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of terry pratchett visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy while some of them used alchemy as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games see also notes references citations

astronomer by johannes vermeer an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside of the scope of earth they look at stars planets moons comets and galaxies as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies there are also related but distinct subjects like cosmology which studies the universe as a whole astronomers usually fit into two types observational astronomers make direct observations of planets stars and galaxies and analyse the data theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers have to observe snap shots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die they use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial bodies work there are further subcategories inside these two main branches of astronomy such as planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or cosmology academic galileo is often referred to as the father of modern astronomy guy consolmagno vatican observatory analyzing a meteorite two zero one four emily lakdawalla at the planetary conference two zero one three historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory the number of professional astronomers in the united states is actually quite small the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately seven zero zero zero members this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy the international astronomical union comprises almost one zero one four five members from seven zero different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a charge coupled device ccd camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable in college university most astronomers get a ph d in astronomy or physics keeping in mind how few astronomers there are it is understood that graduate schools in this field are very competitive so grades are very important students must take a graduate record exam in the united states if they wish to be accepted into a u s graduate school amateur astronomers while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from seven zero different nations like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research however amateurs span the range from so called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able

columns six and seven and international organization for standardization tc nine seven sc two voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard the x three two four task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may one nine six three meeting locating the lowercase letters in columns six and seven caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper

values of two three four five six seven eight nine were were placed in second column rows one five corresponding to the digits one five in the adjacent column the parentheses could not correspond to

corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with eight and nine this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit paired keyboards notably the teletype model three three which used the left shifted layout corresponding to ascii not to traditional mechanical typewriters electric typewriters notably the more recently introduced ibm selectric one nine six one used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computersfollowing the ibm pc one nine eight one especially model m one nine eight four and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did the pair also dates to the no two and the pairs were used on some keyboards others including the no two did not shift comma or full stop so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting however ascii split the pair dating to no two and rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly to some common characters were not included notably while were included as diacritics for international use and for mathematical use together with the simple line characters in addition to common the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented in the french variation so the was placed in position four zero hex right before the letter a the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message som end of address eoa end of message eom end of transmission eot who are you wru are you ru a reserved device control dc zero synchronous idle sync and acknowledge ack these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns character order ascii code order is also called asciibetical order collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence the main deviations in ascii order are all uppercase come before lowercase letters for example z comes before a digits and many punctuation marks come before letters for example four precedes one numbers are sorted na vely as strings for example one zero precedes two an intermediate orderreadily implementedconverts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values na ve number sorting can be averted by zero filling all numbers e g zero two will sort before one zero as expected although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself character groups control characters ascii reserves the first three two codes numbers zero three one decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ascii or to provide meta information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape for example character one zero represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character eight represents backspace rfc two eight two two refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as non whitespace control characters except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line oriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of delete probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model three three asr which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader punch option paper tape was a very popular medium for long term program storage until the one nine eight zero s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape in particular the teletype model three three machine assignments for codes one seven control q dc one also known as xon one nine control s dc three also known as xoff and one two seven delete became de facto standards the model three three was also notable for taking the description of control g bel meaning audibly alert the operator literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character because the keytop for the o key also showed a left arrow symbol from ascii one nine six three which had this character instead of underscore a noncompliant use of code one five control o shift in interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected when a teletype three three asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control s xoff an abbreviation for transmit off it caused the tape reader to stop receiving control q xon transmit on caused the tape reader to resume this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique on some systems control s retains its meaning but control q is replaced by a second control s to resume output the three three asr also could be configured to employ control r dc two and control t dc four to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively code one two seven is officially named delete but the teletype label was rubout since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes interpretations of this code varied the original teletype meaning and the intent of the standard was to make it an ignored character the same as nul all zeroes this was useful specifically for paper tape because punching the all ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it tapes designed to be hand edited could even be produced with spaces of extra nuls blank tape so that a block of characters could be rubbed out and then replacements put into the empty space some software assigned special meanings to ascii characters sent to the software from the terminal operating systems from digital equipment corporation for example interpreted del as an input character as meaning remove previously typed input character and this interpretation also became common in unix systems most other systems used bs for that meaning and used del to mean remove the character at the cursor that latter interpretation is the most common now many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones the escape character esc code two seven for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings c language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning over time this meaning has been co opted and has eventually been changed in modern use an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so called ansi escape code or more properly a control sequence introducer from ecma four eight one nine seven two and its successors beginning with esc followed by a left bracket character an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out of band character used to terminate an operation as in the teco and vi text editors in graphical user interface gui and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogether the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and line feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary the entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line dec operating systems os eight rt one one rsx one one rsts tops one zero etc used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device originally teletype machines would work by the time so called glass ttys later called crts or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention when gary kildall created cp m he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in dec s rt one one until the introduction of pc dos in one nine eight one ibm had no hand in this because their one nine seven zero s operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless ibm s pc dos also marketed as ms dos by microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of cp m and windows inherited it from ms dos unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed lf alone as a line terminator unix and unix like systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos on the other hand used carriage return cr alone as a line terminator however since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix based os x operating system they now use line feed lf as well computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops one zero and tenex using cr lf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os three six zero that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal nvt so that connections between hosts with different line ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network telnet used ascii along with cr lf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for e mail and the world wide web on systems not using the nvt s cr lf line ending convention older operating systems such as tops one zero along with cp m tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control z sub to mark the end of the actual text in the file for this reason eof or end of file was used colloquially and conventionally as a three letter acronym for control z instead of substitute the end of text code etx also known as control c was inappropriate for a variety of reasons while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard in c library and unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such null terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here z stands for zero rowspan two rowspan two name one nine six three one nine six five one

ascii itself was first used commercially during one nine six three as a seven bit teleprinter code for american telephone so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemer ross code in europe because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii on march one one one nine six eight u s president lyndon b johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july one one nine six nine must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december two zero zero seven when utf eight encoding surpassed it utf eight is backward compatible with ascii variants and derivations as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve ascii s character map in the seven bit range furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii seven bit codes from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso six four six one nine six seven that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdom s pound sterling almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the usa and a few other countries for example canada had its own version that supported french characters many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non english letters e g currency symbols e g etc see also yuscii yugoslavia it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii one nine six three and iso s first acceptance of an international recommendation during one nine six seven caused ascii s choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points iso iec six four six like ascii is a seven bit character set it does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general text processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso iec six four six a german french or swedish etc programmer using their national variant of iso iec six four six rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as a i n instead of c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use many programmers kept their computers on us ascii so plain text in swedish german etc for example in e mail or usenet contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to for example a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get nsar as the answer which should be n jag har sm rg sar meaning no i ve got sandwiches eight bit codes eventually as eight one six and three two bit and later six four bit computers began to replace one eight and three six bit computers as the norm it became common to use an eight bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended eight bit relatives of ascii in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first one two eight i e seven bit characters encodings include iscii india viscii vietnam although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard most early home computer systems developed their own eight bit character sets containing line drawing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from zero to three one with more graphics kaypro cp m computers used the upper one two eight characters for the greek alphabet the petscii code commodore international used for their eight bit systems is probably unique among post one nine seven zero codes in being based on ascii one nine six three instead of the more common ascii one nine six seven such as found on the zx spectrum computer atari eight bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants the ibm pc defined code page four three seven which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper one two eight positions operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set dec mcs for use in the popular vt two two zero terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets the iso iec eight eight five nine standard derived from the dec mcs finally provided a standard that most systems copied at least as accurately as they copied ascii but with many substitutions a popular further extension designed by microsoft windows one two five two often mislabeled as iso eight eight five nine one added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing iso eight eight five nine one windows one two five two and the original seven bit ascii were the most common character encodings until two zero zero eight when utf eight became more common iso iec four eight seven three introduced three two additional control codes defined in the eight zero nine f hexadecimal range as part of extending the seven bit ascii encoding to become an eight bit system unicode unicode and the iso iec one zero six four six universal character set ucs have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec eight eight five nine and ascii rapidly in many environments while ascii is limited to one two eight characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural numbers called code points and encoding to eight one six or three two bit binary formats called utf eight utf one six and utf three two ascii was incorporated into the unicode one nine nine one character set as the first one two eight symbols so the seven bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets this allows utf eight to be backward compatible with seven bit ascii as a utf eight file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only seven bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set as is often done to support eight bit ascii extensions such as iso eight eight five nine one will preserve utf eight data unchanged to allow backward compatibility the one two eight ascii and two five six iso eight eight five nine one latin one characters are assigned unicode ucs code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards therefore ascii can be considered a seven bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of unicode ucs and ascii when prefixed with zero as the eighth bit is valid

traditional animation a horse animated by rotoscoping from eadweard muybridge s one nine th century photos traditional animation also called cel animation or hand drawn animation was the process used for most animated films of the two zero th century the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings the completed character cels are photographed one by one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the two one st century today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional three five mm film and newer media with digital video the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past seven zero years some animation producers have used the term tradigital to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technologies examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio united states

us one nine nine six and osmosis jones us two zero zero one stop motion animation stop motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement there are many different types of stop motion animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation computer software is widely available to create this type of animation however traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive and time consuming to produce than current computer animation puppet animation typically involves stop motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment in contrast to real world interaction in model animation the puppets generally have an armature inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints examples include the tale of the fox france one nine three seven the nightmare before christmas us one nine

puppetoon created using techniques developed by george pal are puppet animated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet a clay animation scene from a finnish television commercial clay animation or plasticine animation often called claymation which however is a trademarked name uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop motion animation the figures may have an armature or wire frame inside similar to the related puppet animation below that can be manipulated to pose the figures alternatively the figures may be made entirely of clay in the films of bruce bickford where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes examples of clay animated works include the

zero zero zero model animation refers to stop motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live action world intercutting matte effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop motion characters or objects with live actors and settings examples include the work of ray harryhausen as seen in films jason and the argonauts one nine six three and the work of willis h o brien on films king kong one nine three three go motion is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film which is not present in traditional stop motion the technique was invented by industrial light vermithrax from dragonslayer one nine eight one film object animation refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop motion animation as opposed to specially created items graphic animation uses non drawn flat visual graphic material photographs newspaper clippings magazines etc which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement at other times the graphics remain stationary while the stop motion camera is moved to create on screen action brickfilm a subgenre of object animation involving using lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation these have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites youtube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software pixilation involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters this allows for a number of surreal effects including disappearances and reappearances allowing people to appear to slide across the ground and other effects examples of pixilation include the secret adventures of tom thumb and angry kid shorts computer animation computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer two d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while three d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact three d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer two d animation a two d animation of two circles joined by a chain two d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using two d bitmap graphics or created and edited using two d vector graphics this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping two d animation has many applications including analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated final line advection animation is a technique used in two d animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm three d animation three d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator the animator usually starts by creating a three d polygon mesh to manipulate a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to a three d object or three d environment sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement other techniques can be applied mathematical functions e g gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects fire and water simulations these techniques fall under the category of three d dynamics three d terms cel shaded animation is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software shading looks stark with less

disney created an interactive version of the technology called autonomatronics linear animation generator is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft the animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion parallel to the installed picture frames the concept and the technical solution were invented in two zero zero seven by mihai girlovan in romania chuckimation is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series action league now in which characters props are thrown or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands puppetry is a form of theatre or performance animation that involves the manipulation of puppets it is very ancient and is believed to have originated three zero zero zero years bc puppetry takes many forms they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects puppetry is used in almost all human societies both as entertainment in performance and ceremonially in rituals celebrations and carnivals most puppetry involves storytelling toy story zoetrope at disney california adventure creates illusion of motion using figures rather than static pictures zoetrope is a device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures the term zoetrope is from the greek words zo meaning alive active and tropos

animation a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying oil paints on sheets of glass for example by aleksandr petrov erasure animation a technique using traditional two d media photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image for example william kentridge is famous for his charcoal erasure films and piotr duma a for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster pinscreen animation makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen the screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows the technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with traditional cel animation sand animation sand is moved around on a back or front lighted piece of glass to create each frame for an animated film this creates an interesting effect when animated because of the light contrast flip book a flip book sometimes especially in british english called a flick book is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next so that when the pages are turned rapidly the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change flip books are often illustrated books for children they also be geared towards adults and employ a series of photographs rather than drawings flip books are not always separate books they appear as an added feature in ordinary books or magazines often in the page corners software packages and websites are also available that convert digital video files into custom made flip books character animation multi sketching special effects animation production the creation of non trivial animation works i e longer than a few seconds has developed as a form of filmmaking with certain unique aspects one thing live action and animated feature length films do have in common is that they are both extremely labor intensive and have high production costs the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live action films it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live action film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the one nine three zero s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes will make sense as a whole while live action films are now also storyboarded they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards i e real time improvisation another problem unique to animation is the necessity of ensuring that the style of an animated film is consistent from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger animators like all artists necessarily have their own individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style was selected for a particular film since the early one nine eight zero s feature length animated films have been created by teams of about five zero zero to six zero zero people of whom five zero to seven zero are animators it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match each other s styles it is harder to keep dozens of artists synchronized with one another this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles on traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles unlike live action films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film in the early one nine six zero s animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays while also continuing to use story departments and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late one nine eight zero s criticism criticism of animation has become a domineering force in media and cinema since its inception with its popularity a large amount of criticism has arisen especially animated feature length films many concerns of cultural representation psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture certain under representation of women has been criticized in animation films and the industry awards as with any other form of media animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field the original awards for animation were presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for animated shorts from the year one nine three

complex of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology the ideal of the kouros a beardless athletic youth apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music truth and prophecy healing the sun and light plague poetry and more apollo is the son of zeus and leto and has a twin sister the chaste huntress artemis apollo is known in greek influenced etruscan mythology as apulu as the patron of delphi pythian apollo apollo was an oracular god the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius yet apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill health and deadly plague amongst the god s custodial charges apollo became associated with dominion over colonists and as the patron defender of herds and flocks as the leader of the muses apollon musegetes and director of their choir apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry hermes created the lyre for him and the instrument became a common attribute of apollo hymns sung to apollo were called paeans in hellenistic times especially during the three rd century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios titan god of the sun and his sister artemis similarly equated with selene titan goddess of the moon in latin texts on the other hand joseph fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of apollo with sol among the augustan poets of the one st century not even in the conjurations of aeneas and latinus in aeneid xii one six one two one five apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the three rd century ce etymology the name of apollo itself though not paean a possible name of a precursor god to or epithet of him is generally considered to be absent from the linear b mycenean greek texts although it is possible that the name is in fact attested in the lacunose form pe rjo linear b on the kn e eight four two tablet the etymology of the name is uncertain the spelling in classical attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form apellon is more archaic derived from an earlier it probably is a cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings apellaia at the initiation of the young men during the family festival apellai according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word apella which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the ecclesia r s p beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a pre greek proto form apalyun several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors thus the greeks most often associated apollo s name with the greek verb apollymi to destroy plato in cratylus connects the name with apolysis redemption with apolousis purification and with haploun simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon ever shooting hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric apella which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation sekos fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds in the ancient macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word pella the capital of ancient macedonia and pell n pallene a number of non greek etymologies have been suggested for the name the hittite form apaliunas d is attested in the manapa tarhunta letter perhaps related to hurrian and certainly the etruscan aplu a god of plague in turn likely from akkadian aplu enlil meaning simply the son of enlil a title that was given to the god nergal who was linked to shamash babylonian god of the sun the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus mouse apollo by chryses the trojan priest of apollo with the purpose of sending a plague against the greeks the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is of course apotropaic meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot with doric a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter greco roman epithets apollo like other greek deities had a number of epithets applied to him reflecting the variety of roles duties and aspects ascribed to the god however while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth only a few occur in latin literature chief among them phoebus phoibos literally bright which was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans in apollo s role as the god of light as sun god and god of light apollo was also known by the epithets aegletes aigl t s from light of the sun helius helios literally sun phanaeus phanaios literally giving or bringing light and lyceus lykeios from proto greek light the meaning of

reputedly founded by his son acraepheus and as smintheus smintheus sminthian that is of the town of sminthos or sminthe near the troad town of hamaxitus the epithet smintheus has historically been confused with mouse in association with apollo s role as a god of disease for this he was also known as parnopius parnopios from locust and to the romans as culicarius from latin culic rius of midges

austria apollo belenus was a healing and sun god apollo cunomaglus hound lord a title given to apollo at a shrine at nettleton shrub wiltshire may have been a god of healing cunomaglus himself may originally have been an independent healing god apollo grannus grannus was a healing spring god later equated with apollo apollo maponus a god known from inscriptions in britain this may be a local fusion of apollo and maponus apollo moritasgus masses of sea water an epithet for apollo at alesia where he was worshipped as god of healing and possibly of physicians apollo vindonnus clear light apollo vindonnus had a temple at essarois near ch tillon sur seine in present day burgundy he was a god of healing especially of the eyes apollo virotutis benefactor of mankind apollo virotutis was worshipped among other places at fins d annecy haute savoie and at jublains maine et loire origins the omphalos in the museum of delphi the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the eight th century bce the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollo s twin sister at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho for the greeks apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed a dorian northwest greek component a cretan minoan component and a syro hittite component from his eastern origin apollo brought the art of inspection of symbols and omina semeia kai terata and of the observation of the omens of the days the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced from anatolia the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning the greeks created the legalism the supervision of the orders of the gods and the demand for moderation and harmony apollo became the god of shining youth the protector of music spiritual life moderation and perceptible order the improvement of the old anatolian god and his elevation to an intellectual sphere may be considered an achievement of the greek people healer and god protector from evil the function of apollo as a healer is connected with paean the physician of the gods in the iliad who seems to come from a more primitive religion pae n is probably connected with the mycenean pa ja wo ne linear b but this is not certain he did not have a separate cult but he was the personification of the holy magic song sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean the magicians were also called seer doctors and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the terrible vedic god of disease rudra he sends a terrible plague to the achaeans the god who sends a disease can also prevent from it therefore when it stops they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a hecatomb to ward off evil when the oath of his priest appeases they pray and with a song they call their own god the beautiful paean some common epithets of apollo as a healer are paion literally healer or helper epikourios help oulios healed wound also a scar and loimios plague in classical times his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil and was therefore called apotropaios divert deter avert and alexikakos from v n defend from evil in later writers the word usually spelled paean becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollo s son asclepius the healer about the four th century bce the paean became merely a formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered it was in this way that apollo had become recognised as the god of music apollo s role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won dorian origin apollo victorious over the python by the florentine pietro francavilla dated one five nine one depicting apollo s first triumph when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent python which lies dead at his feet the walters art museum the connection with dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars but it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos the homeric hymn represents apollo as a northern intruder his arrival must have occurred during the dark ages that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization and his conflict with gaia mother earth was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python the earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated a female dragon named delphyne womb who is obviously connected with delphi and apollo delphinios and a male serpent typhon to smoke the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy who the narrators confused with python python was the good daemon of the temple as it appears in minoan religion but she was represented as a dragon as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology in greek mythology artemis was the leader hegemon of the nymphs who had similar functions with the nordic elves the elf shot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves but it was later attested denoting stone arrow heads which were used by witches to harm people and also for healing rituals the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiba is a healer physician god however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult minoan origin ornamented golden minoan labrys it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean ages in historical times the priests of delphi were called labryaden the double axe men which indicates minoan origin the double axe labrys was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices apollo delphinios was a sea god especially worshiped in crete and in the islands and his name indicates his connection with delphi and the holy serpent delphyne womb apollo s sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the mister of the animals a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute his original name is unknown but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular apollo who stood by the virgin mistress of the animals becoming her brother the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspiration prophecy existed in the temple this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries according to the local tradition in that regard the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolian origin with her ecstatic art looks unrelated to the oracle itself however the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurel leaves which seem to be confirmed by recent studies plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women obsessed by mania frenzy a greek word he connected with mantis prophet frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc although crete had contacts with mari from two zero zero zero bc there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece anatolian origin illustration of a coin of apollo agyieus from ambracia a non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship the name of apollo s mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylonian texts and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites in a hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a babylonian priestess for a certain purification a similar story is mentioned by plutarch he writes that the cretan seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae and that the seer s expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia and proves together with the homeric hymn that crete had a resisting religion up to historical times it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war he is pictured as a terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods the god seems to be related to appaliunas a tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates a babylonian origin the late bronze age from one seven zero zero to one two zero zero bce hittite and hurrian aplu was a god of plague invoked during plague years here we have an apotropaic situation where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it aplu meaning the son of was a title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash homer interprets apollo as a terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing a magic art that separates him from the other greek gods in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats all these functions including the function of the healer god paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo oracular cult columns of the temple of apollo at delphi greece unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo the apollo of delphi were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality apollo s cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about six five zero bce apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites in the two nd and three rd century ce those at didyma and clarus pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity in the three rd century apollo fell silent julian the apostate three five nine six one tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed oracular shrines delos lions apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in clarus and branchidae his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesus his oracular shrines include abae in phocis bassae in the peloponnese at clarus on the west coast of asia minor as at delphi a holy spring which gave off a pneuma from which the priests drank in corinth the oracle of corinth came from the town of tenea from prisoners supposedly taken in the trojan war at khyrse in troad the temple was built for apollo smintheus in delos there was an oracle to the delian apollo during summer the hieron sanctuary of apollo adjacent to the sacred lake was the place where the god was said to have been born in delphi the pythia became filled with the pneuma of apollo said to come from a spring inside the adyton in didyma an oracle on the coast of anatolia south west of lydian luwian sardis in which priests from the lineage of the branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple was believed to have been founded by branchus son or lover of apollo in hierapolis bambyce syria modern manbij according to the treatise de dea syria the sanctuary of the syrian goddess contained a robed and bearded image of apollo divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image at patara in lycia there was a seasonal winter oracle of apollo said to have been the place where the god went from delos as at delphi the oracle at patara was a woman in segesta in sicily oracles were also given by sons of apollo in oropus north of athens the oracle amphiaraus was said to be the son of apollo oropus also had a sacred spring in labadea east of delphi trophonius another son of apollo killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle temples of apollo a lot of temples dedicated to apollo were built in greece and in the greek colonies and they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations some of the earliest temples especially in crete don t belong to any greek order it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings the first buildings were narrow to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics the doric order dominated during the six th and the five th century b c but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldn t be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome the most important temples are greek temples thebes greece the oldest temple probably dedicated to apollo ismenius was built in the nine th century b c it seems that it was a curvilinear building the doric temple was built in the early seven th century b c but only some small

she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma in her wanderings leto found the newly created floating island of delos which was neither mainland nor a real island she gave birth there and was accepted by the people offering them her promise that her son would be always favourable toward the city afterwards zeus secured delos to the bottom of the ocean this island later became sacred to apollo it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace nine yards eight m long of amber mythographers agree that artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of apollo or that artemis was born one day before apollo on the island of ortygia and that she helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo apollo was born on the seventh day hebdomagenes of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him youth four days after his birth apollo killed the chthonic dragon python which lived in delphi beside the castalian spring this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophecies hera sent the serpent to hunt leto to her death across the world to protect his mother apollo begged hephaestus for a bow and arrows after receiving them apollo cornered python in the sacred cave at delphi apollo killed python but had to be punished for it since python was a child of gaia hera then sent the giant tityos to rape leto this time apollo was aided by his sister artemis in protecting their mother during the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus there he was pegged to the rock floor covering an area of where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver trojan war apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the trojan war in retribution for agamemnon s insult to chryses a priest of apollo whose daughter chryseis had been captured he demanded her return and the achaeans complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad in the iliad when diomedes injured aeneas apollo rescued him first aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by apollo who took him to pergamos a sacred spot in troy apollo aided paris in the killing of achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into achilles heel one interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for achilles sacrilege in murdering troilus the god s own son by hecuba on the very altar of the god s own temple admetus when zeus struck down apollo s son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting hippolytus from the dead transgressing themis by stealing hades s subjects apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever for this but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor due to the intercession of his mother leto during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly admetus treated apollo well and in return the god conferred great benefits on admetus apollo helped admetus win alcestis the daughter of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time if another took his place but when it came time for admetus to die his parents whom he had assumed would gladly die for him refused to cooperate instead alcestis took his place but heracles managed to persuade thanatos the god of death to return her to the world of the living artemis and apollo piercing niobe s

a number of the niobids were spared chloris usually amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them consorts and children love affairs ascribed to apollo are a late development in greek mythology their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the renaissance the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination female lovers apollo and daphne by bernini in the galleria borghese daphne was a nymph daughter of the river god peneus who had scorned apollo the myth explains the connection of apollo with daphn the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at delphi in ovid s metamorphoses phoebus apollo chaffs cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man whereupon cupid wounds him with a golden dart simultaneously however cupid shoots a leaden arrow into daphne causing her to be repulsed by apollo following a spirited chase by apollo daphne prays to her father peneus for help and he changes her into the laurel tree sacred to apollo artemis daphnaia who had

apollo for herself told orchamus the truth betraying her sister s trust and confidence in her enraged orchamus ordered leucothea to be buried alive apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved and a grieving clytia wilted and slowly died apollo changed her into an incense plant either heliotrope or sunflower which follows the sun every day marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi at the base of mt parnassos which was then named after her water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses in the last oracle is mentioned that the water which could speak has been lost for ever by cyrene apollo had a son named aristaeus who became the patron god of cattle fruit trees hunting husbandry and bee keeping he was also a culture hero and taught humanity dairy skills the use of nets and traps in hunting and how to cultivate olives hecuba was the wife of king priam of troy and apollo had a son with her named troilus an oracle prophesied that troy would not be defeated as long as troilus reached the age of twenty alive he was ambushed and killed by achilleus cassandra was daughter of hecuba and priam and troilus half sister apollo fell in love with cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her but she rejected him afterwards enraged apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her coronis was daughter of phlegyas king of the lapiths pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus a crow informed apollo of the affair when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black where they were previously white as a punishment for spreading untruths when he found out the truth he sent his sister artemis to kill coronis in other stories apollo himself had killed coronis as a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur chiron to raise phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of

was one of apollo s male lovers he was a spartan prince beautiful and athletic the pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly apollo is said to be filled with grief out of hyacinthus blood apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection meaning alas the festival of hyacinthus was a celebration of sparta another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth cyparissus asked apollo to let his tears fall forever apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk other male lovers of apollo include admetus atymnius otherwise known as a beloved of sarpedon branchus alternately a son of apollo carnus clarus hippolytus of sicyon not the same as hippolytus the son of theseus hymenaios iapis leucates who threw himself off a rock when apollo attempted to carry him off phorbas probably the son of triopas potnieus apollo s lyre upright apollo with his lyre statue from pergamon museum berlin hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes his mother maia had been secretly impregnated by zeus maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep hermes ran to thessaly where apollo was grazing his cattle the infant hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cow s intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in so maia refused to believe apollo s claim zeus intervened and claiming to have seen the events sided with apollo hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented apollo a god of music fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre hence apollo then became a master of the lyre apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war and cassandra a prophetess of apollo apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon s son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes furies female personifications of vengeance apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage they invade his temple and he says that the matter should be brought before athena apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollo s supplicant apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo other stories apollo killed the aloadae when they attempted to storm mt olympus callimachus sang that apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the hyperboreans during the winter months apollo turned cephissus into a sea monster another contender for the birthplace of apollo is the cretan islands of paximadia musical contests pan once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo the god of the kithara to a trial of skill tmolus the mountain god was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment he dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey marsyas upright marsyas under apollo s punishment stanbul archaeology museum apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague bringing death dealing arrows marsyas was a satyr who challenged apollo to a contest of music he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy the contest was judged by the muses after they each performed both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time as apollo played the lyre this was easy to do marsyas could not do this as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time apollo was declared the winner because of this apollo flayed marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god he then nailed marsyas shaggy skin to a nearby pine tree marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas another variation is that apollo played his instrument the lyre upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument the flute and so apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive cinyras apollo also had a lyre playing contest with cinyras his son who committed suicide when he lost upright seven five head of apollo marble roman copy of a greek original of the four th century bce from the collection of cardinal albani roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks as a quintessentially greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus on the occasion of a pestilence in the four three zero s bce apollo s first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare during the second punic war in two one two bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollo s temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in one seven bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era festivals the chief apollonian festivals were the boedromia carneia carpiae daphnephoria delia hyacinthia metageitnia pyanepsia pythia and thargelia attributes and symbols gold stater of the seleucid king antiochus i soter reigned two eight one two six one bce showing on the reverse a nude apollo holding his key attributes two arrows and a bow apollo s most common attributes were the bow and arrow other attributes of his included the kithara an advanced version of the common lyre the plectrum and the sword another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers the pythian games were held in apollo s honor every four years at delphi the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas symbolizing music and song hawks ravens crows snakes referencing apollo s function as the god of prophecy mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin apollo citharoedus apollo with a kithara musei capitolini rome as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization seven five zero five five zero bce according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy however this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention a minor asian god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars in this interpretation apollo s title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the god s supposed link with wolves possibly a folk etymology in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase apollo is often associated with the golden mean this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony apollo in the arts the louvre apollo sauroctonos roman copy after praxiteles three six zero bc apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance the earliest greek word for a statue is delight agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole a method created by polykleitos finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism with stylization art and greek philosophy the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions which changed from the natural philosophy of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras thales searched for a simple material form directly perceptible by the senses behind the appearances of things and his theory is also related to the older animism this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life through unnaturally simplified forms pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation the forms on earth are imperfect imitations eikones images of the celestial world of numbers his ideas had a great influence on post archaic art and the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation that would lead to the esthetic perfection canon in classical greece anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason mind gave order to the seeds of the universe and plato extended the greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms ideai ideas the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas the greek words oida i know and eidos species have the same root as the word idea indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses to the principles beyond the senses the artists in plato s time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization the greek sculptors considered the senses more important and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual archaic sculpture sacred gate kouros marble six one zero six zero zero bc kerameikos archaeological museum in athens kouros male youth is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of apollo the first statues are certainly still and formal the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egyptian precedent but it was accepted for a good reason the sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is and embodied the archaic smile of good manners the firm and springy step the balance of the body dignity and youthful happiness when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods the adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented these forms expressed immortality apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order his shrine in delphi that he shared in winter with dionysius had the inscriptions gn thi seaut n know thyself and m d n gan nothing in excess and egg a p ra d at make a pledge and mischief is nigh new york kouros met mus three two one one one marble six two zero six one zero bc metropolitan museum of art in the first large scale depictions during the early archaic period six four zero five eight zero bc the artists tried to draw one s attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses but as being full of life the greeks maintained until late in their civilization an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself a fine example is the statue of the sacred gate kouros which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens dipylon kouros the statue is the thing in itself and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body giving the impression that the statues could move it is considered that he created also the new york kouros which is the oldest fully preserved statue of kouros type and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself piraeus apollo archaic style bronze archaeological museum of piraeus the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths in stories of the god hephaestus phaistos and the mythic daedalus the builder of the labyrinth that made images which moved of their own accord this kind of art goes back to the minoan period when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment these free standing statues were usually marble but also the form rendered in limestone bronze ivory and terracotta the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the late archaic period five two zero four eight five bc in which the greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo it was found in piraeus the harbour of athens the statue originally held the bow in its left hand and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand it probably comes from north eastern peloponnesus the emphasis is given in anatomy and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion and beauty relative to proportions which appear mostly in post archaic art the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which with an independently developed harder simpler and heavier style restricts ionian influence in athens finally this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later classical sculpture apollo of the mantoua type marble roman copy after a five th century bce greek original attributed to polykleitos mus e du louvre in the next century which is the beginning of the classical period it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else consisted of symmetry and proportions the artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment myron which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element anatomy and geometry are fused in one and each does something to the other the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions just as they sought some reality behind appearances polykleitos in his canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements materials but of the parts that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm the type is represented by neo attic imperial roman copies of the late one st or early two nd century modelled upon a supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the five th century bce in a style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic the apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm of which in the louvre example a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps though the proportions were always important in greek art the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze age just as the greeks saw the mountains forests sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form and the form of a work of art spiritual life is incorporated in matter when it is given artistic form just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self things as we see them and as they really are are one that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity pediments and friezes upright apollo west pediment olympia munich copy from original four six zero bce at the temple of zeus olympia greece in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollo s tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration their two figures hold the centre in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene part of the bassae frieze at the british museum apollo and artemis in the northeast corner these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space but only as parts in a larger whole while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy hellenistic greece rome apollo as a handsome beardless young man is often depicted with a kithara as apollo citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on a tree the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late one five th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the one nine th century the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between three five zero and three two five bce the life size so called adonis found in one seven eight zero on the site of a villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars in the late two nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even a god s divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the three rd century bce to depict alexander the great some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed

agassi and sampras squared off for an exhibition in london for the annual world tennis day this time it was agassi who came out on top in two straight sets playing style early in his career agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first strike tennis typically by inducing a weak return with a deep hard shot and then playing a winner at an extreme angle his groundstrokes return of serve baseline game anticipation phenomenal eye hand coordination were always among the best in the game on the rare occasion that he charged the net agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner his favored groundstroke was his flat accurate two handed backhand hit well cross court but in particular down the line his forehand was nearly as strong in particular his inside out forehand to the ad court agassi s strength was in dictating play from the back of the court while he was growing up his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way when in control of a point agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more this change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach brad gilbert in their first year together in one nine nine four gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted agassi s two handed backhand down the line as his very best shot a signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it agassi s serve was never the strength of his game but it improved steadily over the course of his career to being above average he often used his hard slice serve to the deuce service box to send his opponent off the court followed by a shot to the opposite corner agassi s service speed when hitting a flat first serve would range between his second serve usually was a heavy kick serve in the mid eight zero s range agassi was raised on hardcourts but found much of his early major tournament success on the red clay of roland garros reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career his first major win was at the slick grass

bangladesh nepal and the southern border of china the name austroasiatic comes from the latin words for south and asia hence south asia of these languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have a long established recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status as modern national languages in vietnam and cambodia respectively the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups ethnologue identifies one six eight austroasiatic languages these form thirteen established families plus perhaps shompen which is poorly attested as a fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as mon khmer and munda however one recent classification posits three groups munda nuclear mon khmer and khasi khmuic while another has abandoned mon khmer as a taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across india bangladesh nepal and southeast asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken they appear to be the autochthonous languages of southeast asia with the neighboring indo aryan tai kadai dravidian austronesian and sino tibetan languages being the result of later migrations typology the austroasiatic languages are well known for having a sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of a reduced minor syllable plus a full syllable many of them also have infixes the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal normal voice and breathy lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voice languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three or even four way voicing contrast however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis proto language much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto mon khmer in harry l shorto s mon khmer comparative dictionary little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented with their demotion from a primary branch proto mon khmer becomes synonymous with proto austroasiatic paul sidwell two zero zero five reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto mon khmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in sidwell two zero one one suggests that the likely homeland of austroasiatic is the middle mekong in the area of the bahnaric and katuic languages approximately where modern laos thailand and cambodia come together and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed dating to perhaps two zero zero zero bce internal classification linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh however no evidence for this classification has ever been published each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic is debated in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accept traditional mon khmer as a valid unit however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra diffloth the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo adelaar one nine nine five sidwell two zero zero nine two zero one one paul sidwell and roger blench propose that the austroasiatic phylum had dispersed via the mekong river drainage basin paul sidwell two zero zero nine a in a lexicostatistical comparison of three six languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence sidwell rongic many words of austroasiatic origin have been noticed in lepcha suggesting a sino tibetan superstrate laid over an austroasiatic substrate blench two zero one three calls this branch rongic based on the lepcha autonym r ng other languages with proposed austroasiatic substrata are jiamao based on evidence from the register system of jiamao a hlai language thurgood one nine nine two jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary g rard diffloth two zero zero five diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations though like other classifications the evidence has not been published as a schematic we have two label two khasi khmuic two label three nuclear three two two or in
